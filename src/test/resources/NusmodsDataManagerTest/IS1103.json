Students will learn about the importance of Ethics in Computing policy-making and be able to make judgements and decisions based on established ethical frameworks (such as Deontology, Consequentialism, Social Contract Theory and Virtue Ethics). The objective is to develop students to be ethical computing decision-makers who can analyse and explain their decisions in real-world policy-making situations. Issues in emerging areas such as Digital Intellectual Property Rights, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Social Media, Hacking, and interface design may also be discussed in relation to Ethics.",
