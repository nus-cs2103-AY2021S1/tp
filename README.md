* **ZooKeep** is a desktop app for managing animals under a zookeeper’s care, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ZooKeep can get your management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

  Example usages:
  * Adding a new animal under your care.
  * Viewing the list of animals under your care.
  * Removing a specific animal.
  
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ZooKeep Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w15-4.github.io/tp/)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
