* This is **software engineering project done by Team W14-4 from CS2103**.<br>
  The project aims to:
  * help medical supply managers keep track of medical products and storage
  * allow fast typists to reap the benefit of swift user interaction with CLI and GUI

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named `CLI-nic` because it emphasizes on user interaction via CLI and serves to smoothen the clinical product's supply flow.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-w14-4.github.io/tp/)**.
