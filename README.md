* This is **Software Engineering (SE) project to help students plan and schedule workouts**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a tracker to help students track their BMI
  * as a planner to help students plan their workout sessions
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _fitNUS_) used for helping students plan workouts.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `fitNUS`.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
