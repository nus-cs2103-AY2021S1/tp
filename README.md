* tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of the 
(imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is optimized 
for Command Line Interface (CLI) users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

* It is named tCheck, which is a word play on tea Check. This application is tailor-made for bubble tea shop managers, to help them on store management.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see
    * [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md)
    * [Developers Guide](docs/DeveloperGuide.md)
    * [About Us](docs/AboutUs.md)

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
