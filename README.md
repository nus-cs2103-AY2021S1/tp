**ResiReg** (**Res**idential **Reg**ulation) is a desktop app designed to help admin staff at Residential Colleges (RCs)* in NUS with their daily tasks. ResiReg allows admin to manage room and student records, including the allocation students to rooms.

**ResiReg** has the following main features:

* Manage records of students.
* Manage records of rooms.
* Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College
* Useful productivity features such as command history, command aliasing and in-app help.

Our application is geared towards users who prefer typing over mouse actions, so interactions with our application are mainly keyboard based.
