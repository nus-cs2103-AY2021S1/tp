* This project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FlashNotes_) used for managing flashcards.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Flash Notes Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/) **.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org) If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
