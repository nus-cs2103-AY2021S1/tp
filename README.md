# TrackIt@NUS

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

TrackIt@NUS is an all-in-one desktop application for NUS students to manage their modules, tasks and lessons in school. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type fast, TrackIt@NUS can improve your efficiency in managing your tasks and classes over using traditional GUI apps.

## Example Usages:
* As a module manager to check:
  * Classes
  * Times and venues (and/or Zoom links)
  * Browse module-related information
* As a task manager for module-related work
* As a contacts manager for school-related contacts

For more details about usage, refer to the user guide at `docs/UserGuide.md`.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
