* This is **a CS2103 Project done by Wei Jie, Joven and Javier from NUS**. It is called Insurance4insurance and is targeted for insurance agents
 to save the details of the clients and connections that they meet.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Adding client's details into the app
  * Adding the different policies of the client.
  * Deleting client's entries. 
* The project makes use of an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details and would fine-tune it
such that it can be used as a client tracking software for insurance agents.
* At the end of the project, we would want to ensure that: 
  * Our end product is a **working product** and can actually be used to record client information. 
  * Our end product will have **no** bugs. 
  * The project comes with a **reasonable number of tests**.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Insurance4Insurance` (`I4I` for short) because we thought that this app would be a form of insurance for insurance advisors such that they do not forget their clients.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see [here](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-t16-2.github.io/tp/).

* Credits:
    * This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
