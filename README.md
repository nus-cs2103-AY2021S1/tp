# SWEe!

* SWEe! is a desktop application used for managing CS2103T learning progress mainly through flashcards.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC)
  than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `SWEe!` (`Software Engineering Everyday!`) as we want users to use the product daily as a means to
improve their learning.
* Example Usages:
    * Create new flashcards with questions and answers
    * Review all flashcards one by one
    * Quiz yourself with the created flashcards
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SWEe! Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t17-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
