# McScheduler

[![CI Status](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/actions)

McScheduler is a **one-stop solution for McDonald's Shift Managers to manage shift scheduling and worker
contact/compensation, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

With the McScheduler, McDonald's Shift Managers can easily access all information needed for shift-work assignment.
