## Reeve
![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

**Reeve** is a desktop app for **private tutors to manage the details of their students**, optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for receiving inputs while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for displaying information.  

* This project is a fork of an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called AddressBook)
    * It is written in **OOP fashion**.
    * It comes with **user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [**Reeve Product Website**](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/).
