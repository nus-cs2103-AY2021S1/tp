# GradPad

GradPad is a one-stop solution to **module management** for Computer Science Undergraduates.
Planning for modules has always been a tedious process but it does not have to be.

The current approach to planning and tracking graduation requirements is to open up tabs after tabs of NUS resources such as 
[NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/) and [websites](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/curr/) of the School of
 Computing, which can be messy at times. 
So, the GradPad team has come up with the idea of an **easy-to-use**, **all-in-one application** that
can ease the process of **module management** for Computer Science Undergraduates.

GradPad **consolidates** the modules you have taken and **displays** the remaining required modules to
ease your module planning process. A **module searching platform** is also included in GradPad, providing easy
**navigation** of modules.
