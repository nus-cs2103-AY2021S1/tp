* **IntelliJournal** is a **desktop app for managing journals as well as contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, IntelliJournal can help you record down journal entries with contacts as well as location information faster than traditional GUI apps.
