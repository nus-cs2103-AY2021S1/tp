#### Introduction

* **ZooKeep** is a desktop app for managing animals under a zookeeperâ€™s care,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
ZooKeep can get your management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

  Example usages:
  * Adding a new animal under your care.
  * Viewing the list of animals under your care.
  * Removing a specific animal.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ZooKeep Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w15-4.github.io/tp/)**.
