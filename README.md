  Example usages:
  * as a learning application for students taking CS2040s
  * as a platform for consolidation of CS2040s content
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _DSAce_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `DSAce` because it is an app to help users ace their data structure and algorithm(CS2040S)
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[DSAce Product Website](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6fUQ2X6h_n4gxUxrcXxbq_z4Xk9ENjbd8flsvDFf-A/edit?ts=5f4b41e0)**.
