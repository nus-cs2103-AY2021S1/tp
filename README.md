Having a tough time keeping track of patients' appointment? No time for noodles because of the never-ending appointment calls?
Fret not, Nuudle is here to help!

Nuudle is a desktop application that empowers clinic nurses, allowing them to **manage patient records and clinical appointments** with ease.
It is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and supports a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Nuudle gets your appointment scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
