ConciergeBook is a desktop app for hotel receptionists to efficiently
manage guest bookings via a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).<br/>
If you can type fast, ConciergeBook can help you optimise how you manage your rooms,
your guests and all new and existing bookings - faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start
* Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
* Download the latest `conciergebook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/releases).
* Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ConciergeBook.
* Run `java -jar conciergebook.jar` in your terminal/cmd.

## Main features
1. Manage hotel bookings
2. Manage hotel guests
3. Order room services and return total bill for a booking
