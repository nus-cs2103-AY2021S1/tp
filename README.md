# StonksBook

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

StonksBook is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This brownfield project is adapted and evolved from the CS2103T sample project **AddressBook Level 3**.

For a detailed documentation of StonksBook, visit **[our product website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t11-1.github.io/tp/)**.
