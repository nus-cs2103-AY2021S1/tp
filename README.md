Inventoryinator is built for dedicated and experienced gamers of MMORPGs who want
fast inventory management with CLI.

Most games lack robust inventory management. This project simplifies management
and tracking of inventories for hardcore gamers. It allows users to keep track
of their inventory through quick commands that support many types of shortcuts.
Users can also save recipes and check if they have sufficient materials in
their inventory to utilise a recipe.
