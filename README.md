TAskmaster is a desktop app for managing students, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a CS Teaching Assistant who can type fast, TAskmaster can help you track your students' attendance and class participation faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using TAskmaster, head over to the [**User Guide**](UserGuide.md).
* If you are interested about developing TAskmaster, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
