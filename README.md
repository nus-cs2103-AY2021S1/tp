![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

Eva is a desktop app for human resource management, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Eva can get your human resource management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
