* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `McGymmy` because it is a catchy name.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[McGymmy Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-3.github.io/tp/)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* Libraries used: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [JUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)
