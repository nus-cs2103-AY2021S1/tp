* Modduke is a integrated addressbook with scheduler functionalities targeted at NUS Students<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a one stop place to keep track of contact details related to NUS's modules e.g. Professors, project group mates
  * as a calendar to keep track of project meetings
  * as a calendar to keep track of consultations with professors

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _ModDuke_) used for managing contact details and meetings.

  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Modduke` because it was initially created with similar functionality of the `Duke iP`, while modifying its functionality to suit NUS students.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Modduke Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-f10-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* Our group is extending the functionality of the application to specifically serve NUS students managing many projects from different modules.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.A
