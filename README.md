- CAP5Buddy is a project developed for a software engineering module (CS2103T) at the National University of Singapore.
  - CAP5Buddy is a desktop application that helps NUS SoC students to keep track of their module details efficiently, optimized for use via a
    **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
  - It helps them centralize key module details and follows their study
    progress by allowing efficient management of module details.
  - CAP5Buddy is morphed from the AddressBook-Level3 project.
  - It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 20 KLoC) than what
    students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.
- For detailed documentation of this project, see the [CAP5Buddy Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f12-3.github.io/tp/).
