# Welcome to ForgetfulNUS!
  ForgetfulNUS is a **flashcard application** designed to assist students currently learning the **German Language**,
  specifically those undertaking the **NUS modules LAG1201 and LAG2201**, as a **memory aid for vocabulary**.
* Example usages:
  * Self-testing with a scoring system
  * Build a user-customised glossary
  * More to come!
* As the app is still in early development, some features are still a work in progress. Expect to see more updates in the near
    future!
* While the app is usable by any party, some features cater *specifically* to NUS students undertaking LAG1201 and LAG2201
