## Project scope
* ProductiveNUS is a desktop application that provides an accessible platform for NUS computing students to manage and keep track of their academic tasks at hand.  

 * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) 
 than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
 * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
 
## Motivation
* As a NUS Computing Student, you would probably have had **difficulties managing your
academic schedule**. You might often feel overwhelmed due to 
**tight deadlines** for your assignments along with a **high workload** which you might be
on the verge of being unable to 
cope with. In events like this, having a **disorganised timeline** makes your
situation worse. You might often **underestimate the time
it takes** to complete your assignments and you might be **late for your lessons** as you were preoccupied 
with completing them. However, all these
tasks still remain uncompleted. You might have been spinning your wheels.
* ProductiveNUS minimises such problems by helping you keep track of your schedule easily.

## Aim
* **Effective time management** among NUS Computing students, resulting in **higher productivity**.
* **Efficiency** in browsing through all your academic tasks (lessons and assignments) at once.
* **Better planning** of your academic schedule.
