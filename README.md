# About Warenager
Warenager is an **inventory management application** to help warehouse managers
of small scale companies keep track of stocks in their warehouse.
It **optimizes inventory management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not
exhaustive of **updating, searching and sorting stocks** via Command Line Interface (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
