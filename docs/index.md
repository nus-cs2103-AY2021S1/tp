**Jarvis is a desktop application for NUS CS1101S tutors to facilitate and lessen their administrative workload.**

While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Jarvis, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#3-quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Jarvis, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
