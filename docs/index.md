**StudyBananas is a desktop study companion app that helps students centralize all their study tasks and set up focused study sessions in one place**. 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using StudyBananas, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing StudyBananas, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
