**tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of 
  the (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is 
  optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI) users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.**

* If you are interested in using tCheck, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing tCheck, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
