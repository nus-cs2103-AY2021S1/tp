**CanoE-COACH is a desktop application for managing training schedules for secondary school canoe teams.** While it has a GUI, most of the user
 interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using CanoE-COACH, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing CanoE-COACH, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
 start.
