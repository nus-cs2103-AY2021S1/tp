This project is a food recipe management system that aims to make it easier for people to manage their recipes and ingredients. Potential users include:
- NUS students living on campus aiming to cook more to save money
- Home cooks trying to cook a wider variety of meals

The project is implemented in Java with a command-oriented interface in a GUI context. It is written to be modular, making it easier for multiple people to contribute to the project at once.

User guides and developer guides are also provided for users and developers to quickly get up to speed on the project.

The name “ChopChop” comes from a Cantonese phrase that means to “hurry up”, reflecting the speed in which users can use our application to manage their recipes. It’s also related to the act of chopping, a common action in the kitchen.
