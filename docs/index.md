fitNUS is tailored for **NUS students** that are interested in staying healthy and keeping fit. It is suitable for **all
fitness levels** and is equipped with a customisable **Timetable** for you to manage your time wisely and slot in your
workout routines with ease. fitNUS also displays a **Calorie Graph** to track your daily caloric intake and expenditure.


The application is extremely easy to use, all you have to do is type in your commands in the command box, and the
information will be reflected in the user interface for ease of viewing.

* If you are interested in using fitNUS, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing fitNUS, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
