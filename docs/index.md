**OneShelf** is a desktop application for you to manage your restaurant inventories and pending deliveries.
It is easy to build and customise your inventory items and pending deliveries
by using only Command Line Interface. If you are a busy restaurant manager who prefers
to use the Command Line Interface and needs to keep track of inventories and deliveries,
 **OneShelf** is definitely for you.

* If you are interested in using OneShelf, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing OneShelf, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
