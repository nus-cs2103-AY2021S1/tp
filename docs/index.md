Have you ever lost track of where you stopped reading your last book or misplaced your bookmark?
Fret no more, **bookmark** is here to save the day!<br>

reading progress into one place.
Example usages:
* Adding a book and its current bookmark
* View a specific book and its details
* Update the details of a specified book
* Delete a specified book
* Listing all books in the application
