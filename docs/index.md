**Insurance4Insurance (I4I) is an app for insurance agents to manage clients.** 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using I4I, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing I4I, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
