**Productiv is a desktop application for product managers like yourself to organise your product-related information.** 
While it has a Graphical User 
Interface, most of your user interactions will happen through a Command Line Interface.

Want to be **productive** in managing your **product**? Head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start) to get started!
Otherwise, for those keen on developing Productiv, you may have a look at our [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html).
