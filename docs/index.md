**DSAce is a desktop application for managing your CS2040S revision.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using DSAce, head over to the [User Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-t14-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).
* If you are interested about developing DSAce, the [Developer Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-t14-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
