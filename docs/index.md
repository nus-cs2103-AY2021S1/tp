**TR4CKER is a desktop application for busy students to manage their tasks.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TR4CKER, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing TR4CKER, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a great place to start.
