**Reeve** is a desktop application for **private tutors to better manage both administrative and academic details of their students**, optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for receiving inputs while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for displaying information.

* Interested in using Reeve? Head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#2-quick-start)!
