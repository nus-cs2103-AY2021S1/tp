**ResiReg** (**Resi**dential **Reg**ulation) is a productivity app designed to help admin staff at Residential Colleges (RCs) in NUS with their daily tasks. 

**ResiReg** has the following main features:

- Manage records of students.
- Manage records of rooms.
- Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College

Our application is geared towards users who prefer typing over mouse actions, so interactions with our application are mainly keyboard based.
