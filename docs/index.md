**Flashnotes is a desktop application for managing and revising your study materials through flash cards.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Have you ever wanted to study for exams using flashcards but found the process of creating and maintaining unbearably long?

Or maybe you found it hard to find the discipline for sticking to a flashcard based system? 

Then FlashNotes is just the app for you! It has an extremely simple and easy flashcard management process, on top of helping you to track your own revision progress in real time.

* To get started, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in the source code for FlashNotes, reading the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) would be a good place to start.
