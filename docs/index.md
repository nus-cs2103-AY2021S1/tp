**The KanBug Tracker is a desktop application for managing the tracking of bugs you encounter, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using KanBug Tracker, head over to the [**User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing KanBug Tracker, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
