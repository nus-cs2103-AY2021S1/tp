**FitEgo is a desktop application for fitness instructors to keep track of his/her customers easily, so that he can
spend more time on his clients / his routine rather than manually tracking administrative matters using alternative software like Excel.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using FitEgo, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing FitEgo, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
