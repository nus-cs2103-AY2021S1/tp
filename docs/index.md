**Covigent is a desktop app for managing information of quarantined individuals and the tasks to be done by staff of the quarantine facilities**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type fast, Covigent can improve your efficiency in managing your patients and tasks instead of using traditional GUI apps.
