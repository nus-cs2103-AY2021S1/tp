Common Cents is a money-tracking app to help small business owners to organise their expenses. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). <br>

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _CommonCents_) used for managing businesses with expenses and revenues.
  * It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 10 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [our Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/).
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* If you are interested in using Common Cents, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the User Guide]((UserGuide.html#quick-start)).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [Developer Guide](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
