### v1.2 Postmortem
*Fine$$e is coming into shape - Ian Yong, 2020*

Our current workflow is working well and everyone is aware of our SOPs. However, we will be making minor workflow adjustments to make the process more convenient.

#### Workflow changes
 - Allowed to work on upstream branches instead of forks.
    - Individuals can stick to forks if they want.
 - Investigate feasibility of UI testing. If not viable, then remove it from the testing suite.

### Actionables
 - Single List Implementation
    - `ModelManager`: 3 filteredLists for Transactions, Incomes and Expenses respectively, `FinanceTracker`: 1 transactionList **(Yong Ping)**
    - Show the differentiation between Incomes, Expenses and Transactions in the Overview Tab **(Siddarth)**
 - Storage **(Yong Ping)**
    - 2 lists (expenses and incomes) in json data file
    - Add frequent expenses and incomes
 - Analytics **(Ian and Siddarth)**
    - Check if we can get a POC for using data visualisation tools with Data2Viz and then request if the library can be used **(Siddarth)**
    - Metrics to be displayed
        - Monthly Expenses
        - Monthly Incomes
        - Monthly Savings
        - Category expenditure within the month (To show which category the user has spent on the most for the month)
 - Set monthly budget (budget == expense limit) **(Jingjing)**
    - Budget class
 - Monthly saving goals **(Jingjing)**
 - Frequent monthly expenses and incomes **(Siddarth)**
    - Add a class to store frequent expenses/incomes (such frequent expenses/incomes will be in a separate list)
    - Add commands to add, edit, delete frequent expenses/incomes
    - Add a command to convert frequent expenses/incomes to actual expense/incomes
 - Check if json data reading validation is present **(Jingjing)**
    - Dates, amounts, etc must all be in the correct format **(Throw error if someone messes with the data file)**
 - Standardise transaction amount format **(Wei Liang)**
    - Change the type of data in `Transaction` from `String` to `Currency`
    - (Stretch Goal) Command: '$' prefix change to depend on locale
    - Convert everything to $XX.XX format to read in input, then convert to numbers when calculating to analytics
 - Standardise date format and add validation **(Wei Liang)**
    - Prevent user from adding transactions which has a date that is later than the current date of entry
    - Change the type of data in `Date` from `String` to `LocalDate`
    - In Analytics, make use of `YearMonth` instead of `LocalDate`
 - Bring up test coverage **(Ian)**
    - Add suppression/exclusion for areas that are not feasible to cover
    - Aim to reach 100% mutation coverage (after suppressions), then set pitest to fail build when coverage drops below 100% - prevent regression in test coverage
 - Search transactions by field **(Jingjing)**
    - Edit find commands to be similar to edit commands e.g `find INDEX KEYWORD`
