### Standards for Issues and PRs

Issues from user stories:
- Refer to user story issue in body
- Create at the start of each iteration, or at the end of each team meeting

Issues from PRs or follow-up from other issues:
- If you see a possible enhancement or problem while fixing your issue,
  - If it is dependent on your issue in some way, document it under your issue
  - If it is not dependent on your issue, create a new issue. Refer to the original issue if you want.
- If you want to add extensions to the issue in the same PR:
  - Create a new issue
    - Rationale: So that others are aware you are working on this extension and will avoid unnecessary double work
  - Add a new commit for the extension
    - Rationale: So it is captured in commit message when squashed
  - Refer to it in the PR
- Definition of extension:
  - An enhancement that is not required to meet the specifications of the issue, that modifies the behavior of the program
  - Rationale:
    - Behavior changes must be closely monitored to prevent regressions from slipping past reviewers
    - Try to keep independent behavior changes apart from each other
  - Definition of behavior:
    - CLI input or outputs change
    - GUI input or outputs change

Changes not requiring issues:
- Can be put under another PR or be a standalone PR without reference to issues
  - If put under another PR, put in a separate commit (so that it is captured in commit message when squashed)
- Examples:
  - Typos
  - Formatting / style changes
  - Anything under 10 lines not affecting behavior
