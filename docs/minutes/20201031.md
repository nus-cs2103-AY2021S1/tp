Mock Practical Exam
- 16 total issues
- Nothing too serious
- Got a time traveller on our hands [#246](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/issues/246)

To-do for next week:
- Finish fixing bugs in PE
- Do PPP
- Do DG (focus on the features that we have implemented ourselves)
- If time allows: bring up code coverage

Feature freeze:
- [#221](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/issues/221) and [#262](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/issues/262) should be the final enhancement issues
