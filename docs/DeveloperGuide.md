## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the
App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* stores the journal data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed', e.g. the UI
 can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other four components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

Similarly, an alternative model for the Journal is given below. Like the model above, it has a `Tag` list in the
 `Journal`, which `Entry` references, allowing `Journal` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead
  of each `Entry` needing their own `Tag` object.
![BetterModelEntryClassDiagram](images/BetterModelEntryClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the journal data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<!--@@author {Lingy12}-->
### Command alias feature
#### Current Implementation

The current implementation is to keep an enumeration `ValidCommand` which keeps
a class level `HashMap` called `aliasMap`. The `HashMap` maps a `String` to a
`ValidCommand`.

The `key` of the `HashMap` represents a valid alias of its value which is a `ValidCommand`.

The enum is declared as below:

```java
public enum ValidCommand {

    SOME_COMMAND("alias1", "alias2");

    private static final Logger logger = LogsCenter.getLogger(ValidCommand.class);

    /**
     * Map that match alias with valid command
     */
    private static final Map<String, ValidCommand> aliasMap = new HashMap<>();

    /**
     * Valid alias for the commands
     */
    private final String[] aliases;
}
```

1. `aliases` array stores valid alias for each of the `ValidCommand`
2. `aliasMap` maps alias to a `ValidCommand`

Note: *alias1, alias2, alias3* are system's default aliases. Aliases can be extended by calling `ValidCommand#addAlias(ValidCommand command, String alias)`.

Given below is the implementation of constructing the `aliasMap`:

```java_holder_method_tree
/**
   * Creates command alias from aliases list.
   *
   * @param aliases Aliases list.
*/
ValidCommand(String... aliases) {
    this.aliases = aliases;
}
```

Step 1: Construct each `ValidCommand` with a list of `String`

```java_holder_method_tree
static {
        Arrays.stream(ValidCommand.values()).forEach(command -> Arrays.stream(command.aliases)
                .forEach(alias -> {
                    assert aliasMap.get(alias) == null;
                    aliasMap.put(alias, command);
                }));
    }
```

Step 2: Use a class level initializer to construct the `aliasMap`

Given below is the class diagram of related part of command alias feature:

![aliasClassDiagram](images/commandAlias/aliasClassDiagram.png)


Note:

* `XYZCOMMAND` represents the enumeration element for valid commands that can be used in the system*
* `ValidCommand#commandTypeOf(String commandWord)` takes in a command keyword (eg. addj, addc, findc...) and returns a `ValidCommand` which will be used by `IntelliJournalParser`*

* `IntelliJournalParser#parseCommand(String UserInput)` detect the command word and pass in to the `ValidCommand#commandTypeOf(String commandWord)` to find the valid command and produce the `Command` accordingly*

Given below is the sequence diagram of command alias feature (This change only related to `Logic` component, so we omit the execution detail in model):

![aliasSequenceDiagram](images/commandAlias/aliasSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Handling storage for *AliasMap*

 **1. Model component**

* `ModelManager` contains a `AliasMap`

* `Model#updateAlias(Map<String, ValidCommand> map)` updates the model with a `Map`

 **2. Storage component**

* `StorageManager` contains a `AliasMapStorage`

* `AliasMapStorage` is implemented by `JsonAliasMapStorage` which stores `AliasMap` as a Json file

Given below is the class diagram of related part in `Storage` component:

   ![aliasStorageClassDiagram](images/commandAlias/aliasStorageClassDiagram.png)


<!--@@author -->
### Tab navigation feature

IntelliJournal has two tabs for different information to display, one tab for
`AddressBook` and another for `Journal`. The implementation of the tab UI is not
the focus in this section, under this section, it is described how commands
navigates from tab to tab.

#### Current Implementation

The current implementation is to keep track of `boolean` variables under `CommandResult`
class. In `MainWindow`, when `Logic` executes a command, the returned `CommandResult` will specify the
tab navigation behaviours of the executed command, and therefore `MainWindow` can
make `Ui` changes to IntelliJournal and complete the tab navigation.

`CommandResult` implements the following methods to specify tab navigation behaviors.
* `public boolean isAddressBookTab()` - Returns `true` if the command needs to
display the `AddressBook` tab, returns `false` is the command needs to display
the `Journal` tab.
*  `public boolean isSwitch()` - Returns `true` if the command requires to switch
the current displaying tab to the other.
* `public boolean isSameTab()` - Reuturns `true` if the command requires to remain
the current displaying tab.

In `Command` classes, the `execute(Model model)` method returns a `CommandResult`
object. We assume the object to return is `commandResult` which does not have any
specifications on tab navigation behavior. In order to specify the tab navigation
behavior, one can call methods of `CommandResult` and return the following objects
instead.
* `commandResult.setAddressBookTab()` - Specifies the returned `CommandResult` to
navigate to `AddressBook` tab (i.e. `isAddressBookTab()` of the returned object
returns `true`).
* `commandResult.setJournalTab()` - Specifies the returned `CommandResult` to
navigate to `Journal` tab (i.e. `isAddressBookTab()` of the returned object returns
`false`).
* `commandResult.setSwitch()` - Specifies the returned `CommandResult` to switch the
current displaying tab to the other tab (i.e. `isSwitch()` returns `false`).
* `commandResult.setSameTab()` - Specifies the returned `CommandResult` to say on
the same displaying tab as before the execution of the current command (i.e.
`isSameTab()` returns `true`).

In `MainWindow#executeCommand`, the method will examine the returned `CommandResult`
object after `Logic` executes the command. The activity diagram below shows how
`MainWindow#executeCommand` handles tab navigation.

![MainWindowTabNavigationActivity](images/MainWindowTabNavigationActivityDiagram.png)

### Check schedule feature

IntelliJournal allows for users to check all journal entries for a given day,
allowing them to check their schedule for the given day.

#### Current Implementation

The current implementation makes use of the `CheckScheduleCommandParser` as well
as the `CheckScheduleCommand` classes. When `IntelliJournalParser` parses the
command and finds the `check` command, the rest of the command is passed into
the `CheckScheduleCommandParser`, where the rest of the command is parsed.

If the rest of the command is empty, the command is parsed as though we are
using the local date of the machine. Otherwise, if the rest of the command is
not a valid date, we throw an error.

The activity diagram for the parsing of command is given below.

![CheckScheduleActivityDiagram](images/CheckScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagrams show how the check schedule command works:

![CheckScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/CheckScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

In `MainWindow#executeCommand`, the returned `CommandResult` will then set the
tab back to the journal tab if the user is viewing the AddressBook tab.

### Help feature
The `help` command of IntelliJournal allows users to check the usage of a specific
command, or get the link to the User Guide for the usage of all commands.
#### Current Implementation
In the current version of IntelliJournal, the help feature is implemented with
both `HelpCommand` and `HelpCommandParser`. If the user input starts with `help`,
the `IntelliJournalParser` will catch it and pass the rest input into `HelpCommandParser`.

Within the `HelpCommandParser`, there are mainly 3 execution path:
1. If the argument starts with `of/` prefix, it will parse the argument behind `of/` to a
`ValidCommand`, and return a HelpCommand with the `ValidCommand`.
2. If the argument is empty, it will return a `HelpCommand` with the boolean term
`isShowHelpWindow` set to be `true`.
3. Else, it will throw an `ParseException`.

Back to `HelpCommand`, it will choose return a `CommandResult` which can make `MainWindow`
to show the help window if the `isShowHelpWindow` is `true`. Or it will return a
`CommandResult` which could print the usage of a certain valid command into result box.

The following sequence diagrams show how the help command works:
![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit journal feature
#### Current Implementation

The current implementation of editing journal entries follows closely to the same process of editing contacts. Fields supplied as arguments are used to create an `EditJournalEntryDescriptor`, which are used to create a new `Entry` object by taking attributes from the `EditJournalEntryDescriptor` and using the original attributes from the `Entry` being edited in place of any null attributes in the `EditJournalEntryDescriptor`.

```
Title updatedTitle = editEntryDescriptor.getTitle().orElse(entryToEdit.getTitle());
```
In this snippet from `createEditedEntry`, `getTitle()` returns an `Optional<Title>` which is used to determine if the new `Entry` should use the previous' attribute or not. For `Title`, `Date`, and `Description`, this same approach is used.

For the tags and contact list, defensive copies of the tags and contact list are made when creating the
 `EditJournalDescriptor` object. Similarly to how the list of tags are replaced by the arguments passed when editing `Person` in `EditContactCommand`, the `UniquePersonList` used to store contacts in an `Entry` will also be replaced with the contact list provided when calling `EditJournalEntryCommand`.

The respective setters' implementations are shown below.
```
public void setContactList(UniquePersonList contactList) {
    this.contactList = new UniquePersonList();
    contactList.forEach(this.contactList::add);
}

public void setTags(Set<Tag> tags) {
    this.tags = (tags != null) ? new HashSet<>(tags) : null;
}
```
Note that a new `UniquePersonList` is created whenever `setContactList` is called, rather than to simply check if `contactList` is null like in `setTags`.
The resulting `EditJournalDescriptor` object is used along with the `Index` specified to create an
 `EditJournalEntryCommand`, which contains methods to search through and add valid contacts to a resulting `Entry`.

 The following sequence diagram shows how the Edit Journal Entry command works:

## Effort

### Difficulty

We found the project to be quite difficult, as this the first time for multiple
of our group members in making use of an unfamiliar code base to build an
original product.

### Challenges

#### Ui

JavaFx was the used to implement the GUI portion of the application. Since it
was an API that we have not used before, we had to learn how to properly make
use of it.

Since we were not familiar with designing visuals of a product either, we had
trouble getting the product to look as what we envisioned it to be.

#### Storage

Implementing the storage was a hurdle we had to jump. We were incorporating 2
additional features to store, as compared to AB3, where only contacts were being
stored.

The 2 additional features to store are:

1. Journal entries
1. Command aliases

This meant that we had to understand both the given code base properly as well
as learn how json files are used as storage.

In addition to that, the journal entries involved contacts from the address book
as well, so we had to figure out how we wanted to store the contacts in the
entries. We eventually settled on using a unique ID for each contact, and then
storing the ID in the journal entry instead of storing the entire contact.

### Achievements

Our team managed to accomplish quite a lot.

On the UI end, we managed to achieve the GUI that we had envisioned, while also
giving the option for users to switch between pre-established themes.

On features implemented, we managed to add many features that were essential to
the product, such as create, read, edit and deleting of journal entries, and
improvements to the search feature of AB3. We also implemented helpful features
such as management of command aliases, to make the users' experience with our
product much easier, by allowing them to add whatever shortcuts they feel is
helpful to themselves.
