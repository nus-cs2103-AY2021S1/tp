## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes clean-up methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The **Sequence Diagram** below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BugListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `KanBugTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a bug).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the KanBug Tracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Bug>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `KanBugTracker`, which `Bug` references. This allows `KanBugTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Bug` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the KanBug Tracker data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Kanban view window feature

#### Implementation
The Kanban view window would comprise of 4 columns that would divide the list of bug by their states. This would be implemented by putting 4 `BugListPane` in a horizontal box. The 4 `BugListPane` objects would be constructed using a `ObservableList` that contains only the bugs that belong to their respective state. This observable list would be provided by the `LogicManager`. These 4 `BugListPane` objects would be filled when the method `fillInnerParts()` is called by `MainWindow`.

<img src="images/Ui.png" width="450" />

Given below is how the `KanbanPanel` window will create the 4 `BugListPane` objects

Step 1:
The user launches the app and the system initialises the User Interface.

Step 2:
`MainWindow` calls `fillInnerParts()` on `KanbanPanel` .

Step 3:
For each of the 4 states, `KanbanPanel` would call `getFilteredBugListByState()` on logic manager to get the appropriate lists and create the `BugListPane`.

Given below is sequence diagram for the creation of the `BugListPane` objects:

<img src= "images/KanbanBoardUI.png" width = "400">

With the implementation of Kanban view window, commands such as delete, move and edit that depend on the index would not work as expected. This is because Kanban view separates the bugs and places them in different columns. As such, it would be essential to allow the users to execute these commands in Kanban view as we implement the new window. This can be done by allowing the user to choose which column would be affected by these commands.

This can be done by adding the following classes:

- `DeleteByStateCommand` which extends `DeleteCommand`
- `MoveBystateCommand` which extends `MoveCommand`
- `EditByStateCommand` which extends `EditCommand`

These command would take in an extra input to specify which column is being targeted. The list of bugs would then be filtered according to the column specified. The respective parsers would also have to be modified such that a new command could be returned if a column is specified. The following activity diagram summarises what happens when the user enters a delete command.(edit and move command parser would act in a similar way)

<img src = "images/DeleteCommandParserActivityDiagram.png" width ="400">

#### Design considerations

- **Alternative 1**: Use a prefix "c/" to specify which column we are referring to.(Current choice)
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Adds an additional prefix which the user has to remember.
- **Alternative 2**: Allow the users to specify an active column and execute the commands with respect to that column
    - Cons: Need to add an additional command to change the active column.

### Edit Tag feature

This feature allows a user to edit an existing tag of a particular bug. Users will only need to specify the specific tag that they want to edit, which saves them the hassle of having to delete all the tags of the bug and add them again. 

The user can make use of this feature by entering the `editTag` command, which follows the following format: `editTag INDEX (c/COLUMN) ot/OLD_TAG nt/NEW_TAG`. 

To understand in greater depth the format of the command, you may refer to our [User Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#58-editing-a-tag-of-a-bug--edittag)

This section explains:

- How the `editTag` command works and the methods that it invokes during execution (Implementation subsection).
- The various considerations that were weighed when brainstorming the design of the edit tag feature (Design Considerations subsection).
- A summary that shows a simplified Activity Diagram that captures the essential logic in the execution of the `editTag` command (Summary subsection).

#### Implementation

The edit tag feature is mainly facilitated by the `EditTagCommand` and `EditTagByStateCommand` objects. 

In understanding how the `editTag` command works, it is crucial to understand the `execute()` method from both the `EditTagCommand` class and `EditTagByStateCommand` class.

The `EditTagCommand` and `EditTagByStateCommand` classes are largely similar. The only difference is that `EditTagByStateCommand` requires the **state** of a bug to be supplied when creating an instance of `EditTagByStateCommand`. Which object is created depends on the view of the application that the user is in. To understand this in greater depth, you are encouraged to read the following [section](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#kanban-view-window-feature).

The execution of the `execute()` method of  `EditTagCommand` and `EditTagByStateCommand` is largely similar. As such, I will only go through in detail the execution of `execute()` of the `EditTagCommand` for brevity. 

Refer to the sequence diagram below to understand the top-level execution of the   `execute()` method after the user enters a valid `editTag` command.

![EditTagByStateKanBan](images/EditTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for the <code>EditTagCommandParser</code> object and <code>ModifyTagUtility</code> object should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the above diagram, editing the **UI** tag of the bug at index 1 in **List View** to **UserDisplay** involves the following steps:

Step 1: User inputs `editTag 1 ot/UI nt/UserDisplay` to achieve the outcome as described above.

Step 2: This input is saved as a `String` and passed into `LogicManager`.

Step 3: The `String` is passed to `KanBugTrackerParser`, which sends the index of the bug, the old tag value and the new tag value to  `EditTagCommandParser`.

Step 4: The `EditTagCommandParser` checks that the old tag and new tag are valid tags, creates an `EditTagCommand` object with the bug to edit, old tag and new tag and returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 5: `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of `EditTagCommand`.

Step 6: The `EditTagCommand` object then uses the relevant information (bug to edit) to create an instance of a `ModifyTagUtility` object.

Step 7: The `EditTagCommand` object calls the `updateTagInBug(oldTag, newTag)` method of `ModiftTagUtility` to create an updated version of the target bug with the correct new tag.

Step 8:  If the bug is updated successfully, the new state of the target bug is updated in the `Model`. A `CommandResult` object is created and returned to `LogicManager`. The GUI is updated and a success message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, if the bug is not updated. A `CommandResult` object is still created and returned to `LogicManager`. The GUI displays an error message to the user.

#### Design Considerations

- Alternative 1 (Current choice): Create a new `EditTagCommand` to handle this functionality
  - Pros: This implementation allows for better design as it limits the scope of the `EditTagCommand` and allows it to solely focus on implementing the functionality needed.
  - Cons: Requires many more supporting classes to be implemented along side the `EditTagCommand` to support the functionality.
- Alternative 2 : Expand the existing `EditCommand` to handle this functionality
  - Pros: Easy to implement as it requires just adding new prefixes to the existing `EditCommandParser`.
  - Cons: This will turn the edit command into a "catch all" command which makes it difficult to use for the user. Internally, it may increase coupling.

#### Summary

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `editTag INDEX (c/COLUMN) ot/OLD_TAG nt/NEW_TAG` command with the correct format.

![EditTagActivityDiagram](/images/EditTagActivityDiagram.png)

### Add tag feature

This feature allows a user to add tags to a particular bug. Users will only need to specify the  tags that they want to add, which saves them the hassle of having to delete all the tags of the bug and adding them again. 

The user can make use of this feature by entering the `addTag` command, which follows the following format: `addTag INDEX (c/COLUMN) nt/NEW_TAG`. 

To understand in greater depth the format of the command, you may refer to our [User Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#59-adding-a-tag-to-a-bug--addtag)

This section explains:

- How the `addTag` command works and the methods that it invokes during execution (Implementation subsection).
- The various considerations that were weighed when brainstorming the design of the add tag feature (Design Considerations subsection).
- A summary that shows a simplified Activity Diagram that captures the essential logic in the execution of the `addTag` command (Summary subsection).

#### Implementation

The implementation of the add tag feature is greatly similar to that of the edit tag feature. The  difference is that instead of `EditTagCommand` and `EditTagByStateCommand` objects, the add tag feature is facilitated by `AddTagCommand` and `AddTagByStateCommand` objects. As such, to understand the implementation of this feature, it is sufficient to read the introduction of the [implementation of previous section](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#implementation-2).

Refer to the sequence diagram below to understand the top-level execution of the   `execute()` method after the user enters a valid `addTag` command. While the execution is similar to that of the `editTag` command, it differs in some key areas which I will point out. For brevity and to reduce duplicate text, I will redirect you to the steps of the execution of the `editTag` command when necessary.

![AddTagKanBan](images/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for the <code>AddTagCommandParser</code> object and <code>ModifyTagUtility</code> object should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

From the above diagram, add a **UserDisplay** tag to the bug at index 1 in **List View** to involves the following steps:

Step 1: User inputs `addTag 1 nt/UserDisplay` to achieve the outcome as described above.

Steps 2 - 6 are similar to those of the `editTag` command. **AddTag** variants of objects are called instead of the **EditTag** variants used in the execution of the `editTag` Command.

Step 7: The `AddTagCommand` object calls the `addTagsToBug(newTags)` method of `ModifyTagUtility` to create an updated version of the target bug with the newly added tags. 

Step 8 is the same as in the `editTag` command.

#### Design Considerations

The design considerations for this feature are the same as the design considerations for the edit tag feature. As such, you can refer to that section of the Developer Guide [here](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#design-considerations-1).

#### Summary

The activity diagram that summarizes what happens when a user executes a `addTag INDEX (c/COLUMN) nt/NEW_TAG` command with the correct format is similar to that of the activity diagram for the edit tag feature which you can see [here](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#summary). Instead of executing an `editTag` command, the user would execute an `addTag` command in this case.

### Bug priority feature

Feature description: Each bug will now have a priority level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) that will be shown on the GUI. Users
can add or edit a bug with the priority using the `pr/` tag. The priority is optional, but each bug must have at most
one priority only.

#### Implementation

The followings are notable differences between `Priority` and other fields of `Bug`:
- The `VALIDATION_REGEX` of `PRIORITY` will be set such that its constructor can only accept the strings `low`, 
`medium`, `higher` (case-insensitive)
- Aside from the 3 possible states of `Priority` (`low`, `medium` or `high`), it will also have the state ` ` 
that represent when the bug have no priority indicated. This type of `Priority` will be create using an overload 
version of the constructor that accept no argument: `new Priority("low")` will create a low priority, but 
`new Priority()` will create an "empty" priority. 
- We will check if the `Priority` is "empty" before showing it on the UI.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: This is to simplify the code so that every instance of `Bug` is mandatory and also avoid using `null` (which could cause `NullPointerException` and break the app) at the same time.
</div>

Here is a diagram showing how an `AddCommandParser` works with the priorities:

![Priority](images/PrioritySequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario concerning only the bug's priority when the user add a new
bug:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `KanBugTracker` will be initialized with the initial KanBug Tracker state.

Step 2. The user execute the command "add n/Bug name d/Bug description pr/high"

Step 3. Through `LogicManager` and `KanBugTrackerParser`, an `AddCommandParser` will eventually have to parse `"n/Bug name d/Bug description pr/high"`

Step 4. The process will continue, after which an `AddCommand` object will be returned and executed as shown below:

![PriorityExample](images/PriorityExampleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

Regarding the `Priority` class:
- **Alternative 1** (current choice): Create `Priority` as a separate class
    - Pros: Adhere OOP principles
    - Cons: Need to refactor quite a lot in many different places (because we need to change the signature of the
       `Bug`'s constructor, which appear in many places.
- **Alternative 2**: Create `Priority` as a subclass of `Tag` 
    - Cons: Break the Liskov Substitution Principle (Since there can be multiple `Tag`s for each `Bug` but there
    can only be one `Priority`).
    

Regarding the situation when the bug's priority is not indicated:
- **Alternative 1** (current choice): Create a special type called "empty" Priority 
    - Pros: Implementation will be similar to other existing fields.
    - Cons: Need to make sure that this special type will not be shown to users.
- **Alternative 2**: Use `Optional` 
    - Pros: Use imperative programming style, code look neater.
    - Cons: Harder to implement correctly.
- **Alternative 3**: Use `null` 
    - Pros: Easiest to implement.
    - Cons: Risky because of possible `NullPointerException`, also code will look complicated because of the need to check whether the object is `null`.

### Search feature

#### Implementation
The `search` command is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It generates a filtered list (updated by a specified `Predicate<Bug>` as an argument), stored internally as `FilteredList<Bug>`. It should have its own class named `SearchCommand` and inherits from the abstract class `Command`. The command then returns an instance of `CommandResult` upon success and prints feedback to the users.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:  
* `SearchCommand#execute()` - Executes the `search` command.  
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredBugList(Predicate<Bug>)` - Filters internal data storage via its argument `Predicate<Bug>`   

The following class diagram shows the structure of the `search` command implementation:  

![SearchCommandClassDiagram](images/SearchCommandClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `search` feature behaves at each step:  

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `KanBugTracker` will be initialized with the initial KanBug Tracker state.  

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Ui bug d/Displays wrongly the information s/todo t/Ui.java` command to add a new bug to the KanBug tracker. A new bug with the following information is added:  

- name: **Ui bug**
- description: **Displays wrongly the information**
- state: **todo**
- tag: **Ui.java**

Step 3. When there are a lot of bugs in the tracker, it is difficult for the user to look for a particular bug.
The user wants to see the information of the above bug. Then, the user executes `search q/Ui bug`.

Step 4. This `search` command checks if the input is valid and then parses before using it to create a `BugContainsQueryStringPredicate` instance.
The predicate is internally passed and used to filter `FilteredList`.
This results in the information of all the bugs of which the name, description or tags contain <code>Ui bug</code> as a substring displays in the tracker.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the search command:  

![SearchCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The query-string given by the user is <b>case-insensitive</b> and cannot be <b>empty</b>.
</div>

#### Design considerations
**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use new prefix `q/` to take query-string from the users.
- Pros: Easier for the users to search for the bug they want.
- Cons: Might have a lot of relevant bugs shown in the filtered list of records.

**Alternative 2**: Use current field prefixes such as `n/`, `d/` or `t/` to search.
- Pros: No need to create a new prefix.
- Cons: Difficult for the users to search for the bug they want. 



### Note feature

#### Implementation
The note feature is facilitated by `Bug`, `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser`. It adds a new `Note` state that can be parsed by the `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` and stored internally as an `Optional<Note>` object inside `Bug`. This is done to give the user the option to remove the note section if they do not intend on using it.

The added operations by `Note` are internal operations that are handled by the `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` and as a result their functionality is not required elsewhere.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Note` mechanism behaves at each step when used with `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser`.

Step 1: The user launches the application and executes the add command and provides a `Note` input using the `note/` prefix. The `AddCommandParser` then executes and splits the input String into its respective components according to the given prefix.

Step 2: The `AddCommandParser` then wraps the string following the `note/` prefix in an `Optional<Note>` object which is then stored inside the new `Bug` that has been created.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the add command:

<img src="images/NoteAddActivityDiagram.png" width="350">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> If the <code>note/</code> command is not followed by a String, it will result in a message to the user that their input should not be blank.
</div>

Step 3: The user then decides to change the `Note` in the bug that he has just added using the `edit` command accompanied with the `note/` prefix. The `EditCommandParser` then executes and splits the input String into its respective components according to the given prefix.

Step 4: The `EditCommandParser` then copies the unchanged information from the original `Bug` into a new `Bug` while also modifying the `Note` state by wrapping the given input String into an `Optional<Note>` object and storing it in the new `Bug` that has been created. This new `Bug` object then replaces the original object in the KanBug Tracker.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the edit command:

<img src="images/NoteEditActivityDiagram.png" width="400">

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How notes are stored and accessed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the Note object as an Optional<Note> object in Bug.
  * Pros: Prevents a null pointer exception and is a safer implementation while allowing the note field to be optional.
  * Cons: Difficult to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the Note object directly in Bug
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Will run into null pointer exceptions that are hard to trace if the user chooses not to add a note.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  KanBug Tracker should work on any **mainstream OS** as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
3.  KanBug Tracker should be able to hold up to **10000** bug items without a remarkable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
4.  KanBug Tracker should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
5.  The size of the compiled JAR file (KanBugTracker.jar) should be less than 100Mb.
6.  KanBug Tracker should be intentionally designed for a single-user (i.e. KanBug Tracker should not be a multi-user application).
7.  KanBug Tracker should be developed incrementally over the project duration.
8.  The softwareâ€™s codebase should adhere to OOP principles.
