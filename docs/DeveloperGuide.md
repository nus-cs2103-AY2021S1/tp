## Introduction
Welcome to Reeve!

Reeve is an integrated platform specifically catered to Primary, Secondary and Tertiary education private tutors to better manage their students' individual needs.
It contains  students' particulars, administrative and academic details.

Reeve is optimized for users that are very comfortable with typing as it works on a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Students' details are displayed in a neat and organized manner through the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you are looking for an application to better allow you to track your students' administrative and academic details so that you can better meet their needs? Look no further!

## 4. **Design**

### 4.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 4.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 4.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 4.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 4.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### 4.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 5.1 Student administrative details features

The student administrative details feature keeps track of essential administrative student details. The feature comprises of the following commands,
* `AddCommand` - Adds a student into the student list
* `EditCommand` - Edits the details of a particular student
* `DeleteCommand` - Deletes a particular student
* `FindCommand` - Finds students matching certain parameters
* `OverdueCommand` - Finds students who have overdue payments
* `ClearCommand` - Deletes all students in the student list

#### 5.1.1 Add Student Command

The following describes the flow of how `AddCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `AddCommand#execute(Model model)` is called which checks whether
the added student already exists in the `UniqueStudentList`.
2. A unique student is defined by `Name`, `Phone`, `School` and `Year`. If a duplicate student is defined,
a `CommandException` is thrown and the student will not be added.
3. If the added student is not a duplicate, then the `Model#addStudent(Student student)` is called to add the student.
A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message and the added student.
4. The student is be added into `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of events when the `AddCommand` is being executed:

![Flow of Add Student Command](images/AddStudentActivityDiagram.png)

Figure ___. Activity Diagram for AddStudentCommand

#### 5.1.2 Edit Student Command

The edit student feature allows the tutor to edit a particular student within **Reeve**.
It is handled by the `EditCommand`.

The following describes the flow of how `EditCommand` is executed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to edit the existing student to the new edited student.
2. `Model#setStudent(Student student)` is called to replace the student with edited student within the model.
3. `Model#updateFilteredStudentsList(Predicate<Student> predicate)` is then called to update the student list with the new edited student.
4. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a successful message indicating that the student has been edited.
5. The edited student is now shown on the student list.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `EditCommand` execution works.

Figure \___. Activity diagram for `EditCommand` execution

#### 5.1.5 Overdue Command

The overdue payment filter feature allows the tutor to find all students who have not paid their tuition fees in the past month. It is handled by the `OverdueCommand`.

The following describes the flow of how `OverdueCommand` is executed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `OverdueCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to filter all students in Reeve whose last date of payment was more than a month ago.
2. `Model#updateFilteredStudentsList(Predicate<Student> predicate)` is called to find only students that match the above condition. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a successful message indicating the number of matching students.
3. The filtered student list replaces the displayed list on the GUI and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `OverdueCommand` execution works.

![OverdueSequence](images/OverdueSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises the flow of events when `OverdueCommand` is executed.

![OverdueActivity](images/OverdueActivityDiagram.png)

Figure \___. Activity diagram for `OverdueCommand` execution

#### 5.1.6 Schedule Command

This section describes the operations that `ScheduleCommand` performs.

1. Upon successful parsing of the user input date into `LocalDate` , the `ScheduleCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
2. The method `LocalDate#getDayOfWeek()` is then called on the `LocalDate` that is parsed from the user input to get the `dayOfWeek`.
3. The `dayOfWeek` is then used to create a `Predicate<Student>` to check if the student has the same day as the date.
4. Then the method `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Student>)` is then called to filter students based on predicate created in **Step 3**.
5. The StudentListPanel is then populated with the students that have lesson on the day.

The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of events when the `ScheduleCommand` is being executed:

![ScheduleActivity](images/ScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

Figure \___. Activity diagram for `ScheduleCommand` execution

### 5.2 Student questions features

The student questions feature keeps track of questions raised by a student to his tutor. The features comprises of the following commands:

* `AddQuestionCommand` - Adds a question to a specified student
* `SolveQuestionCommand` - Marks a specified question from a specified student as solved
* `DeleteQuestionCommand` - Deletes a specified question from a specified student

#### 5.2.1 Add question command

The following describes the flow of how `AddQuestionCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `AddQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `AddQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if the student already has a similar question recorded.
4. A unique question is defined solely by its `question` and does not take into account if the question has been solved. If a duplicate question is found, a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
5. If the question is not a duplicate, `Student#addQuestion(Question question)` is called to create a modified copy of the student with a newly added question.
6. `Model#setPerson(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the question added.
7. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the question adding operation works.

#### 5.2.2 Solve question command

The following describes the flow of how `SolveQuestionCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `SolveQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `SolveQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if there is a question at the specified position.
4. If the question does not exist, a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be resolved.
5. If the question exists, `Student#setQuestion(Question target, Question newQuestion)` is called to create a modified copy of the student where the specified question has been replaced with a solved version.
6. `Model#setPerson(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the question solved.
7. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the question solving operation works.

#### 5.2.3 Delete question command

The following describes the flow of how `DeleteQuestionCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `DeleteQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `DeleteQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if there is a question at the specified position.
4. If the question does not exist, a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be resolved.
5. If the question exists, `Student#deleteQuestion(Question target)` is called to create a modified copy of the student without the specified question.
6. `Model#setPerson(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the question removed.
7. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the question deletion operation works.

### 5.3 Student Find Command

This is an explanation of how `FindCommand` works.

This is an activity diagram showing the high level idea of how `FindCommand` is executed.

![FindCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

This is a sequence diagram together with an explanation of the implementation.

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

 1. After the `FindCommand`  is created by parsing user input, `FindCommand::execute` is called.
 2. The method then calls `getPredicates()` of the `FindStudentDescriptor` stored within `FindCommand` to obtain a `List<Predicate>` to search with.
 3. The predicates within `List<Predicate>`are then combined into `consolidatedPredicate`.
 4. The `FilteredList<Student>` within the `Model` is then updated using `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate predicate)` for display.
 5. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.
