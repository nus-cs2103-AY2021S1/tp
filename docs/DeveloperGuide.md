## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores FaculType data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI
 can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save FaculType data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find contacts by attributes feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser`. It allows users to search for contacts by
 their respective attributes. It uses `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate p)` which is
  exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredList(Predicate p)`. The method updates the
  current person list and filters it according to the given predicate which will then be shown accordingly in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find by attributes operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** AND Searching from multiple attributes and keywords.
  * Pros: Provides the ability to narrow down search results by adding more keywords and attributes.
  * Cons: Unable to search for multiple persons with different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** AND Searching across attributes, OR Searching between keywords.
  * Pros: Provides the ability to narrow down search results by adding more attributes as well as expanding the search
   scope by adding more keywords (i.e: more flexible).
  * Cons: A possible source of confusion as they use different searching methods.

Both options are equally feasible. However, Alternative 1 was chosen to avoid confusion for prospective users.

### Find module by module attributes feature

#### Implementation

The find module mechanism is facilitated by `FindModCommand` and `FindModCommandParser`. It allows users to search for modules based on their respective attributes which are the module code, module name and instructors teaching the module.
It uses `ModelManager#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate p)` which is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate p)`.
The method updates the current module list and filters it according to the given predicate which will then be reflected accordingly in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find module by module attributes operation works:

![FindmodActivityDiagram](images/FindmodSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a findmod command:

![FindmodActivityDiagram](images/FindmodActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How findmod executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** AND searching from multiple attributes and AND searching between keywords for module name and instructor attributes. Module code attribute only allows single keywords.
  * Pros : Provides the ability to narrow down the search results by adding more attributes and keywords. Single keyword for module code attribute allows for more focused module code searches.
  * Cons : Unable to have a more general search and unable to search for multiple modules with different module codes.

* **Alternative 2:** And searching across attributes and OR searching between keywords for module name and instructor attributes.
  * Pros : Provides the ability for a very general and flexible search.
  * Cons : Unable to have a more focused search, might be more confusing for the user to narrow down his/her searches.

### Deleting Module feature

#### Implementation

The delete module mechanism is facilitated by the `DelmodCommand` and the `DelmodCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#removeModule()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModule()`.
Then, the `removeModuleWithCode()` operation is called in `UniqueModuleList`. `UniqueModuleList#removeModuleWithCode()` will remove the module with the specified code
from the module list.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how the delete module mecahnism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. Facultype is initialized with the module `CS2103` in the addressbook.

Step 2. The user executes the command `delmod m/CS2103` to delete the module with the module code CS2103 in the addressbook.

Step 3. The `delmod` command then calls `Model#deleteModule()` after checking for the existence of the specified module.

Step 4. The Module with the specified module code, will be deleted from the `UniqueModuleList` in the addressbook.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deleting of the module works:

![DelmodActivityDiagram](images/DelmodSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delmod command:

![DelmodActivityDiagram](images/DelmodActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: What the delmod command deletes by
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes a module based on the module code.
  * Pros : More intuitive to the Dean to delete by the module code.
  * Cons : Would be more troublesome to look for the module should the Dean forget the module code.

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes a module based on the index of the module list.
  * Pros : Dean does not have to memorise all the module code, can simply delete based on what is shown in the module list.
  * Cons : Less intuitive.

### Assign feature

#### Implementation

The assign feature is facilitated by `AssignCommand` and `AssignCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#assignInstructor()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#assignInstructor()`.
Then, the `assignInstructor()` operation is called in both `UniqueModuleList` and `Module`. `Module#assignInstructor()` will add the instructor to the module's set of instructors.

The following sequence diagram shows how the assign operation works:

![AssignSequenceDiagram](images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an assign command:

![AssignActivityDiagram](images/AssignActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to store assignments
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A module has a set of instructors assigned to it.
  * Pros: More efficient to list the instructors of a certain module.
  * Cons: Less efficient to list the modules of a certain instructor.

* **Alternative 2:** An instructor has a set of modules they are assigned to.
  * Pros: More efficient to list the modules of a certain instructor.
  * Cons: Less efficient to list the instructors of a certain module.

Both are equally viable options but Alternative 1 was chosen so `Person` would not have to be redesigned or have too many fields.

### Unassign feature

The assign feature is facilitated by `UnassignCommand` and `UnassignCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#unassignInstructor()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#unassignInstructor()`.
Then, the `unassignInstructor()` operation is called in both `UniqueModuleList` and `Module`. `Module#unassignInstructor()` will remove the instructor from the module's set of instructors.

The following sequence diagram shows how the unassign operation works:

![UnassignSequenceDiagram](images/UnassignSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a unassign command:

![UnassignActivityDiagram](images/UnassignActivityDiagram.png)

### Unassignall feature

The assign feature is facilitated by `UnassignallCommand` and `UnassignallCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#unassignAllInstructors()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#unassignAllInstructors()`.
Then, the `unassignAllInstructors()` operation is called in both `UniqueModuleList` and `Module`. `Module#unassignAllInstructors()` will remove all instructors from all modules' set of instructors.

The following sequence diagram shows how the unassignall operation works:

![UnassignallSequenceDiagram](images/UnassignallSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a unassignall command:

![UnassignallActivityDiagram](images/UnassignallActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How unassignall executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Unassigns all instructors from all modules.
 * Pros : More efficient to unassign all instructors from all modules.
 * Cons : Less efficient to unassign a certain instructor from all modules he/she teaches.

* **Alternative 2:** Unassign a certain instructor from all modules he/she teaches.
 * Pros : More efficient to unassign a certain instructor from all modules he/she teaches.
 * Cons : Less efficient to unassign all instructors from all modules.

### Clear all contacts feature

#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:
* `AddressBook#clearContacts()` — Clear all contacts from the list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#clearContacts()` and `UniquePersonList` class as `UniquePersonList#clearAll()`

The following sequence diagram shows how the cclear operation works:

![CclearSequenceDiagram](images/CclearSequenceDiagram.png)

### Clear all modules feature

#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:
* `AddressBook#clearMod()` — Clear all modules from the list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#clearMod()` and `UniqueModuleList` class as `UniqueModuleList#clearAll()`
The following sequence diagram shows how the mclear operation works:

![MclearSequenceDiagram](images/MclearSequenceDiagram.png)

### Switch active semester feature

#### Implementation

The switch feature is facilitated by `AddressBook#switchModuleList()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#switchModuleList()`.

AddressBook has two module lists, one for each semester, and one additional `UniqueModuleList` variable named `activeModules` that stores a reference to the active semester's module list. 
`AddressBook#switchModuleList()` toggles which module list is referenced by `activeModules`.
All `AddressBook` operations on `UniqueModuleList` are done on `activeModules`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the switch operation works:

![SwitchSequenceDiagram](images/SwitchSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a switch command:

![SwitchActivityDiagram](images/SwitchActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Setting the active semester
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** There are two module lists and active semester references one of them.
  * Pros: Less code to change.
  * Cons: Can only manage the modules in the active semester.

* **Alternative 2:** There is only one module list and there is a filter to select modules of a particular semester.
  * Pros: More efficient to list the modules of a certain instructor.
  * Cons: Need to add semester field to modules and commands, will have two copies of the same module if held in both semesters, more code to change.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current FaculType state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous FaculType state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone FaculType state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial FaculType state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single FaculType state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in FaculType. The `delete` command calls
 `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of FaculType after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted FaculType state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook
()`, causing another modified FaculType state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the FaculType state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
 `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous FaculType state, and restores FaculType to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores FaculType to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest FaculType state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify FaculType, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all FaculType states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire FaculType data.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Current bugs and feature ideas**

This section describes bugs found in the current version of FaculType and
feature ideas that have been proposed but currently don't have implementation details yet.
Both of which are to be fixed/implemented in the next version of FaculType.

### Current bugs:

* Editing a contact's identifying attributes (name, phone, email) to be the same as another contact's causes problems due to the detection of duplicate contacts.
This bug is inherited from the parent project AddressBook Level 3.
* A tag in a contact card and an instructor tag in a module card may be cut off if the text inside is too long or if there are too many tags.
This bug is inherited from the parent project AddressBook Level 3.

Example of the tag bug:

![TagBug](images/TagBug.png)

* No validation of instructor existence for modules. Adding a non-existent instructor by editing the 
`addressbook.json` file will not throw any error.

Example of the instructor bug:

![JSONFileComposite](images/JSONFileComposite.png)


![InstructorBug](images/InstructorBug.png)

### Feature ideas:

* Order filter results of contacts and modules by how much they match the specified parameters.
* Differentiate instructor tags in module cards for instructors with the same name.
