## 1&ensp;Introduction

For more information on the ChopChop application itself, read the [_User Guide_](UserGuide.md) instead.

This developer guide specifies the design architecture and details some of the software design decisions in the implementation of the ChopChop application. It is intended to be read by contributors, testers, and future maintainers.

## 2&ensp;Setting Up

To setup the development environment, refer to [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

-------------
## 3&ensp;Design

This section of the developer guide details the overall design of ChopChop, including the various subcomponents and how they fit together.

### 3.1&ensp;Component Architecture

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/cls-overall.png" style="width: 70%" /> <br />
Figure 1: <i>The architecture diagram of ChopChop</i>
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* During launch: initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* During shutdown: shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App broadly consists of these four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The user interface (UI).
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): The in-memory data manager.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): The on-disk data manager.

Each of these components:
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, implementing the corresponding `interface`.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements said interface.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe #1`:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" style="width: 95%" /> <br />
Figure 2: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>delete recipe #1</code></i>
</div>


The following sections break down the various components in greater detail.




----------------
<a name="ui-component"></a>
### 3.2&ensp;UI Component

The *UI* component is responsible for all the user-facing views in the graphical user interface. This includes displaying recipes, ingredients and statistics, receiving command input from the user, and printing command results to the user.

The class diagram of the UI component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/UiClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 3.1: <i>The class diagram of the UI component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`HelpWindow`, `StatsBox`, `CommandOutput`, `DisplayController`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The graphical user interface is built using the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The following activity diagram shows the general flow of events for the UI component when the application is launched:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="diagrams/ui/UiLauchActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 65%"> <br />
Figure 3.2: <i>An activity diagram for the Ui during application launch</i>
</div>

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `list ingredients`:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/UiSequenceDiagram.png" style="width: 95%" /> <br />
Figure 3.3: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>list ingredients</code></i>
</div>


-------------------
<a name="logic-component"></a>
### 3.3&ensp;Logic Component

The *Logic* component is responsible for parsing command input, executing commands, and updating the Model component of any changes to data caused by running a command.

The class diagram of the Logic component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="diagrams/logic/cls-overall.png" /> <br />
Figure 4.1: <i>The class diagram of the Logic component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/logic/Logic.java)

This is the general flow of events when a command is executed:
1. `Logic` uses its `CommandParser` to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. deleting a recipe).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user, or to switch the currently active pane.
1. After command execution, the command is saved by the `HistoryManager` to keep track of command history, and to allow for undoing/redoing of commands.

For example, this is a sequence diagram showing the deletion of a recipe:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" style="width: 95%" /> <br />
Figure 4.2: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>delete recipe #1</code> in the Logic component</i>
</div>










-------------------
<a name="model-component"></a>
### 3.4&ensp;Model Component

The *Model* component is responsible for holding the data of the application (eg. the recipes and ingredients) in-memory during execution, and mediating access to this data for each of the other components of the system.

The class diagram of the *Model* component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/ModelClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 5.1: <i>The class diagram of the Model component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/model/Model.java)

The Model component:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the recipe and ingredient book data.
* Stores the recipe and ingredient usage list data.
* Exposes an `ObservableList` of both `Recipe` and `Ingredient`, for UI component to observe and update its graphical interface.


Of note in the Model component are the `Recipe` and `Ingredient` classes; below is the class diagram for both:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/RecipeIngredient.png"> <br/>
Figure 5.2: <i>The class diagram for Recipes and Ingredients</i>
</div>

Note that an instance of `Recipe` only stores `IngredientReference`s to the ingredients it uses, and not the actual `Ingredient`s themselves â€” since the actual instance of the ingredient that will be used by the recipe is indeterminate.

Only when a recipe is made are the references resolved to their actual ingredient.



---------------------
<a name="storage-component"></a>
### 3.5&ensp;Storage Component

The storage component is responsible for the saving and loading of the usage data for recipe and ingredient, the user preferences, and more importantly the recipe and ingredient data, to and from disk. Both pieces of data are stored in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) files, which is a human-readable (and editable) plain-text format.

Currently, the Jackson library is used for (de)serialisation.

The class diagram of the *Storage* component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/StorageClassDiagram.png"> <br />
Figure 6: <i>The class diagram of the Storage component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/storage/Storage.java)

As mentioned above, the `Storage` component:
* Saves and loads `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves and loads the `RecipeBook` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves and loads the `IngredientBook` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves and loads the `RecipeUsage` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves and loads the `IngredientUsage` objects in json format and read it back.

Each component is saved in a separate file with its file path specified in UserPref.
Each entity (eg. `Recipe`, `IngredientSet`) that needs to be saved has a corresponding `JsonAdapted{X}` class in the `chopchop.storage` package. This adapter class is responsible for converting, using Jackson, the 'normal' objects to a string representation (or to another adapter class), and to convert this string representation back to a 'normal' object.

For example, the `Ingredient` class has a corresponding `JsonAdaptedIngredient` that saves and loads the ingredient's name, quantities, and expiry dates.
It can also be multi-level.
For example, the `JsonSerializableIngredientUsageList` contains `JsonAdaptedUsageList` and `JsonAdaptedUsageList` in turn contains a list of `JsonAdaptedIngredientUsage`.


------------------
<a name="common-classes"></a>
### 3.6&ensp;Utility Classes

While not itself a component, various utility types are placed in the `chopchop.commons` package; these are used by all the components in ChopChop, and comprise three sub-parts in their respective packages:

1. `core` contains classes to handle GUI settings, logging, and versioning.
2. `exceptions` contains exception types common across ChopChop.
3. `util` contains utility classes for file IO and argument validation, as well as functional types.









-----------------------------
## 4&ensp;Implementation Details

This section explains, in detail, the implementation of some noteworthy features.


<a name="ImplCommandParser"></a>
### 4.1&ensp;Command Parser

The command parser is part of the *Logic* component, and is responsible for taking the input command as a string and either returning a valid `Command` to be executed, or a sensible error message. It was completely rewritten due to the requirement of different parsing semantics.

Shown below is the class diagram for the various Parser components:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="diagrams/logic/cls-parser.png" style="width: 85%"> <br />
Figure 7.1: <i>The class diagram for the parser</i>
</div>

Notably, there are various wrapper classes to ensure type safety, namely `CommandArguments`, `ArgName`, and `ItemReference`, used instead of passing raw strings around in an error-prone manner.

Furthermore, instead of pointlessly instantiating objects that do not store any state, all of the parsing work (save the main `CommandParser`) is done by static methods, in the various `XYZCommandParser` classes (eg. `AddCommandParser`, `ListCommandParser`).

The `CommonParser` class holds common methods for each parser, for example quantity parsing and validation (eg. preventing negative quantities), checking for unsupported named arguments, etc.

<i>Developer's note: object-oriented programming (OOP) is meant to encapsulate an objects behaviour with its data. None of the parser classes are stateful, so they do not contain data. Thus, it is pointless to make them instanced objects when static methods will suffice. If Java had namespaces, then that is what the various command-parser-classes would have been instead.</i>


#### 4.1.1&ensp;ArgName

This was inherited from AB3's `Prefix` class, but eventually evolved to include more functionality, due to the addition of *edit-arguments* for edit commands. It serves as an abstraction over the raw string of argument names (eg. `/step`), and also holds information about the components of the argument (eg. `/step:edit:3`).


#### 4.1.2&ensp;ItemReference

Again, this is similar to AB3's `Index` class, but it gained the ability to refer to items by name as well as by index. Commands take an item reference so they do not need to know whether the user referred to an item by its index or by its name.


#### 4.1.3&ensp;Anatomy of a (parsed) Command

During and after parsing, a command is represented by an instance of `CommandArguments`, which holds these fields:
1. The command name
2. The unnamed arguments
3. The list of named arguments

Given the following command string: <br />
`add recipe The Best Pancakes /ingredient Magic /qty 999 /step Poof` <br />
these are its components (here, `<a, b>` denotes a pair of `a` and `b`):
1. Command name: `add`
2. Unnamed arguments: `recipe The Best Pancakes`
3. Named arguments: `[<ArgName(ingredient), Magic>, <ArgName(qty), 999>, <ArgName(step), Poof>]`

Unlike in AB3, the absolute order of named arguments matters, because a `/qty` argument must refer to the `/ingredient` argument immediately preceeding it; thus, the named arguments are stored in a list instead of a map.

For most commands, they take an additional <i>target</i>; this is typically the first word of the unnamed arguments (in this case, `recipe`). For historical reasons, `CommandArguments` does not have a separate field for the target. It does have a `getFirstWordFromRemaining()` method however, which abstracts away this common functionality.




#### 4.1.4&ensp;Parsing Sequence

One of the more complex commands to parse is the `add recipe` command; here is the sequence diagram detailing how it is parsed. For the sake of clarity, the command string will be omitted; you can assume that we are parsing `add recipe Pancakes /ingredient Milk /qty 400ml /ingredient Flour /qty 200g /ingredient Eggs 2 /step Add ingredients /step Mix /step Cook`:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="diagrams/logic/seq-parser-add-recipe.png" style="width: 95%"> <br />
Figure 7.2: <i>A sequence diagram for parsing an <code>add recipe</code> command</i>
</div>


<h4>Design Considerations</h4>
**1. Use of exceptions**

The current parser is written in an exception-free manner, using monadic result types (`Result`, `Optional`) and their composition (`map`, `then`) instead.

  - Option A: Use exceptions.
    - Pros: Easier interfacing with existing AB3 code.
    - Cons: Harder to visualise error source and propagation, calling site gets cluttered with syntactic `try-catch` noise.
  - **Option B (chosen)**: Use monadic types.
    - Pros: More explicit, easier to visualise error source and propagation.
    - Cons: Slightly harder to write.

Since the parser was going to be heavily refactored if not completely rewritten, removing exceptions was the chosen option. An excerpt of this style can be seen below:
```java
return ItemReference.parse(name)
    .then(ref -> Result.transpose(qtys
        .stream()
        .findFirst()
        .map(CommonParser::parseQuantity))
        .map(qty -> new DeleteIngredientCommand(ref, qty)));
```
Here, `Result<T>` is similar to a Java `Optional<T>`, but also encapsulating a descriptive error message in the form of a string.

<i>Developer's note: when it comes down to it, this is a stylistic choice, so I went with what I preferred.</i>

**2. Numbered vs named item references**

ChopChop allows referring to items (recipes and ingredients) both by their full name, as well as by its index number (as in AB3).

  - Option A: Allow only numbers.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Less intuitive for the user, index number can change as views are updated.
  - Option B: Allow only names.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Full name of the ingredient or recipe might be tedious to type out each time.
  - **Option C (chosen)**: Allow both names and numbers.
    - Pros: Best of both worlds.
    - Cons: Slightly more code to implement.

After abstracting out functions that resolve an item reference, code complexity did not increase significantly, and ease-of-use was greatly improved; thus, option C was chosen.




<a name="ImplTabCompletion"></a>
### 4.2&ensp;Tab Completion

This feature allows the user to quickly type in commands and complete long recipe and ingredient names, and greatly reduces the tedium of using a command-line application. Its implementation is not particularly clever and can be described mostly by a state machine.

The main brains of the tab completer lies in determining which <i>kind</i> of item to complete (eg. a command name or a recipe name), and it can be (roughly) represented by the activity diagram below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="diagrams/logic/act-tabcomplete.png" style="width: 65%"> <br />
Figure 8: <i>A high-level activity diagram for the tab completer</i>
</div>

<i>Developer's note: the activity diagram could have been made a lot more detailed, but it would have been completely unreadable.</i>

Most of the logic and complexity of the completer lies in determining which commands require targets, which require ingredient names and so on, and whether or not they should be completed at the given point (ie. the cursor position and the preceeding text).

In the current implementation, some parts are hardcoded with knowledge about which commands accept which arguments; this can be improved, but there were a number of unanswered questions regarding the implementation details, so it will be left to a future iteration to improve upon the abstraction.

Most notably, each command (or, ideally, its parser) should 'own' the knowledge of the arguments that it accepts and the valid targets, so information can be decentralised from the autocompleter.




<a name="ImplQuantities"></a>
### 4.3&ensp;Quantity and Unit Handling

As an application dealing with ingredients, one of the core requirements of ChopChop is being able to track quantities of ingredients, and perform arithmetic on them when cooking recipes (consuming) and refilling those ingredients.

The relationships between the various quantity-related classes are shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="diagrams/model/cls-quantity.png" style="width: 45%"> <br />
Figure 9: <i>The class diagram for the quantity components</i>
</div>

The `Quantity` interface contains a static method that handles parsing a quantity from a string; in the current implementation, it needs to have explicit knowledge about the supported units (in the sense that it lists `Mass`, `Count`, etc). It attempts to parse the input with each unit's parser and returns the first one that succeeds:
```java
return Result.flatten(
    Result.ofOptional(
        knownUnits.stream()
            .map(fn -> num.then(n -> fn.apply(n, unit.toString())))
            .filter(Result::hasValue)
            .findFirst(),
        String.format("Unknown unit '%s' (from '%s')", unit, input))
    );
```

These units are handled as a base `count` and a `ratio`; this allows them to handle arithmetic operations (add, subtract) among themselves. Naturally, only compatible dimensions can interoperate, eg. `Mass` with `Mass`, `Count` with `Count`, etc.

In the current implementation, there are a number of specific units of Volume (*mL*, *L*, *tsp*, *tbsp*, *cup*), and for Mass (*mg*, *g*, *kg*). These units and their ratios are currently hardcoded into the application, but a future extension would allow users to specify their own units (perhaps in a configuration file) that can allow them to use units like *lb*, *oz*, etc.

<h4>Design Considerations</h4>
**1. Unit representation**

  - Option A: Represent units as a simple string.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Less intuitive for the user, only exactly-compatible units can be added.
  - **Option B (chosen)**: Represent units in a typed manner.
    - Pros: Intuitive unit handling for the user.
    - Cons: More implementation effort, supported units must be known in advance.

  The extra implementation effort was deemed to be acceptable to allow for a better user experience. Mainly, the ability to let recipes specify a quantity as *3 cups*, while keeping track of the ingredient in *litres* was a key feature, to save the user the hassle of converting these units before keying them into the application.

  Furthermore, this implementation also allows *rescaling* the quantity, so that `1700mL` can be better displayed as `1.7L`.

**2. User extensible units**
  - Option A: Support custom user-defined units.
    - Pros: More flexible from the user's perspective.
    - Cons: More implementation effort, necessary to integrate (eg. defining units via command line).
  - **Option B (chosen)**: Only allow a fixed set of units.
    - Pros: Less implementation work.
    - Cons: Less flexible from the user's perspective.

  Option B was chosen here due to the limited time available to work on the application. The primary mitigation was to include more commonly-used units built into ChopChop, for instance teaspoons, tablespoons, and cups for volumes.





<a name="ImplHelpCommand"></a>
### 4.4&ensp;Help Command

To improve the user experience for first-time users, a robust help command was implemented into ChopChop. Unlike the AB3 'solution' of simply opening a dialog with a link to the User Guide, ChopChop's help is able to provide a clickable link directly to the correct section in the User Guide for that specific command.

For example, here is the output of `help add recipe`:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ug/help_message_2.png" style="width: 45%"> <br />
Figure 10: <i>The output of `help add recipe`</i>
</div>

This requires two pieces to cooperate:
1. The User Guide must have predictable anchor links that are independent of section numbers and/or formatting
2. Each Command class must have a predictable mapping to said anchor links

To solve the first problem, each section in the UG has an explicitly-named HTML `<a>` tag, corresponding to the name of the command's class in the Java code, like so:
```markdown
<a name="AddRecipeCommand"></a>
#### 5.4.3&ensp;Adding Recipes â€” **`add`**`recipe`
```

This also solves the second problem, because the mapping of the command to its anchor is exactly the class name of the command. However, since the user is asking for help, it is likely that they would not know the necessary arguments to pass to the command, so it is not feasible to require a valid command to be passed to `help`.

In this instance, we cannot make use of polymorphism on instance methods, so reflection was used instead. This relies two things:
1. All command classes must live in the package `chopchop.logic.commands`
2. All command classes must follow the format `<name><target>Command`. For example, `AddRecipeCommand`, or `DeleteIngredientCommand`.

Since the command syntax looks like `add recipe <args>`, it is trivial to transform that into `AddRecipeCommand`, search for the class in the appropriate package using reflection, and call its static methods to get its help blurb (in the figure above, that is "Adds a new recipe").

For the statistics commands taking 2 keywords (eg. `stats recipe top`), they are similarly transformed into `StatsRecipeTopCommand`.

When extending ChopChop to include new commands, it is important to follow these existing guidelines so that the help command continues to work automatically.



<a name="stats-feature"></a>
### 4.5&ensp;Statistics feature


<a name="stats-curr-impl"></a>
#### 4.5.1&ensp;Current implementation

The statistics feature keeps track of the recipes that were made and the ingredients that were consumed in the process.
The feature spans across the 4 main components of ChopChop.
It is mainly supported by `UsageList` and `Usage` in the Model component. `UsageList` and `Usage` are similar to `EntryBook` and `Entry` respectively in terms of their purpose.


<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/UsageClassDiagram.png" style="width: 45%"> <br />
Figure 11: <i>Usage component in Model</i>
</div>

The `Model` interface exposes various operations to support the addition and removal of usages, and getting statistics from `UsageList`.

During the execution of `MakeRecipeCommand`, a `RecipeUsage` and `IngredientUsage`s are created and added to `recipeUsageList` and `ingredientUsageList` through operations in `Model` interface.
Since `MakeRecipeCommand` is undoable, these usages are removed from the lists upon undoing the command.
The process is demonstrated below by the code snippet of `MakeRecipeCommand#undo()`:
```java
        for (var ingredientRef : this.recipe.getIngredients()) {
            model.removeIngredientUsage(ingredientRef);
        }
        model.removeRecipeUsage(this.recipe);
```

After changes to `Model` were made, the `Storage` component saves the `UsageList`s in json format.
Finally, the `StatsBox` is updated based on the `CommandResult` returned after the execution of each command.

<h4>Design Considerations</h4>

This section details the design considerations of the statistics feature.

<a name="stats-design-considerations"></a>

**1. How the usages are tracked and saved.**

  - Option A: Store the history of commands executed. The statistics of recipe and ingredient usages can be computed based on the commands executed. For example, currently there are 10 cabbages and the `make recipe salad` command was executed 3 times yesterday. Assuming salad required 2 cabbages to make, 6 cabbages were used yesterday.
    - Pros:
      - Requires less memory usage.
      - Allows more statistics to be computed as all changes to `Model` have to be done through the execution of a command.
    - Cons:
      - Getting statistics for ingredient usage can be tricky as recipes can be deleted and edited. In the example above, to compute the number of cabbages used, exact ingredient consumptions have to be stored in addition to the `make recipe salad` text command.
      - Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as the history of command is being used for statistics purposes in addition to the `undo` feature which uses a non-persistent history of command.

  - **Option B(chosen)**: Store the relevant information such as name, and the date and time of which the recipe was made or ingredient was used in `Usage` which is then stored in `UsageList`.
    - Pros:
      - Easier to implement.
      - Allows quick access to certain data such as latest recipe usages.
    - Cons:
      - Modifications to `Usage` and its associated classes may be required to support computation of more kinds of statistics.

**2. Responsibility of Usage List.**
  - **Option A(chosen)**: Make `getRecentlyUsed` and `getUsageBetween` return a Pair of Strings.
    - Pros:
      - Easier to implement.
    - Cons:
      - Violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
  - Option B: Make `getRecentlyUsed` and `getUsageBetween` return intermediate values.
    - Pros:
      - `UsageList` only needs to handle adding, removing and returning of `Usage`.
    - Cons:
      - Additional processing is required in `ModelManager`.

**3: GUI of statistics box.**
  - **Option A(chosen)**: Update the statistics box after every execution of command.
    - Pros:
      - The user will be shown recently made recipes list after they executed non-statistics commands (other than `stats recipe recent`). This makes the app feel more responsive as both `StatsBox` and `CommandOutput` panels are updated.
    - Cons:
      - Additional computation required to refresh `StatsBox`.
      - The user might want to have previous stats command results stay in the statistics box for future reference.
  - Option B: Notify and update statistics box with `CommandResult` in `MainWindow` only after the execution of statistics commands.
    - Pros:
      - The statistics results remain in the statistics box even after the execution of other commands so the user does not have to execute the statistics command again to view the statistics.
    - Cons:
      - The user will have to execute `stats recipe recent` to obtain the default view on statistics box again.

<a name="stats-related-commands"></a>
#### 4.5.2&ensp;Related commands

`StatsCommandParser` parses the Statistics commands and returns the corresponding `Command object` based on user's input.
For more information on the Parser, view [4.1 Command Parser](#41command-parser). 


The 7 supported statistics commands are `StatsRecipeTopCommand`, `StatsRecipeMadeCommand`, `StatsIngredientUsedCommand`, `StatsRecipeRecentCommand` and `StatsIngredientRecentCommand` which update the `recipeList` in `StatsBox`, as well as `StatsRecipeClearCommand` and `StatsIngredientClearCommand` which remove all `Usage` in their respective `UsageList`.
All the statistics commands function in a similar way so we will go through just one of the commands in details below.

<a name="view-top-recipes"></a>
<h4>View top recipes command</h4>

The view top recipes command allows the user to see the recipes that were made the most number of times based on the `Usage` saved in `UsageList`.
It is executed with an object of `StatsRecipeTopCommand` which is created after parsing `stats recipe top` as the user command.

The sequence diagram below shows the sequence of interactions between the `Model` and the `Logic` components after the user command `stats recipe top` is executed.

Figure 12.1 <i>The sequence diagram of the execution of StatsRecipeTopCommand </i>
</div>

1. `LogicManager` uses `CommandParser` to parse the user input.
2. `CommandParser` calls on the static method `parseStatsCommand` of `StatsCommandParser` class.
3. `StatsCommandParser` then calls on methods `getCommandTarget` and `parseRecipeStatsCommand` to determine which command object should be instantiated.
4. A `StatsRecipeTopCommand` object is instantiated by `StatsCommandParser`.
5. This object is passed back to and executed by the `LogicManager`.
6. `StatsRecipeTopCommand` calls `getMostMadeRecipeList` of `Model` and the result of which is encapsulated in `CommandResult`.
7. This `CommandResult` object is passed back to `LogicManager`. Additionally, the object then updates `StatsBox` to display a list of top recipes and a confirmation message as shown below. (this interaction is not shown in this sequence diagram).

### 4.6&ensp;Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo feature is implemented using a `HistoryManager`, which keeps track of and stores the command history, along with a list of parsed undoable `Command`s.
Every command that can be undone/redone implements the `Undoable` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Undoable#undo()` method.
Optionally, the command can implement the `Undoable#redo()` method to customise the default behaviour, which is to re-execute the command.
The `HistoryManager` then implements the following operations:

* `HistoryManager#addInput()` â€” Saves the command history of the last input entered
* `HistoryManager#addCommand()` â€” Saves the last parsed command (if it is undoable)
* `HistoryManager#undo()` â€” Undo the last `Undoable` command
* `HistoryManager#redo()` â€” Redo the last `Undoable` command

The `HistoryManager#undo()` and `HistoryManager#redo()` methods move the current command history pointer and carries out the requested operation.
Further details can be seen in the example usage scenario detailing the mechanism below.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `HistoryManager` is initialised with an empty list of `CommandHistory`s, as no commands have been entered, and the `currentIndex` pointer is intialised to 0.

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/state/UndoRedoState0.png"> <br />
Figure 13.1: <i>The initial state of HistoryManager</i>
</div>

Step 2. The user executes `delete recipe #5` to delete the 5th recipe from the recipe book.
The model is updated accordingly, and the `DeleteRecipeCommand` is saved by the `HistoryManager` by adding to the `CommandHistory` list, as the command implements the `Undoable` interface.
The `currentIndex` pointer is also incremented by one, as the application is currently at the state after the `DeleteRecipeCommand` is executed.

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/state/UndoRedoState1.png"> <br />
Figure 13.2: <i>The state of HistoryManager after command "delete recipe #5"</i>
</div>

Step 3. The user executes `add recipe beef noodles` to add a new recipe.
Similarly, the model is updated accordingly, and the `AddRecipeCommand` is added to the `CommandHistory` list.
The `currentIndex` pointer is once again incremented by one.

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/state/UndoRedoState2.png"> <br />
Figure 13.3: <i>The state of HistoryManager after command "add recipe beef noodles"</i>
</div>

Step 4. The user now desires to undo the last action, and executes the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `HistoryManager#undo()`, which will decrement the `currentIndex` pointer by one and retrieve the command from the list at the specified index.
The command's `Undoable#undo()` operation will then be executed.

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/state/UndoRedoState3.png"> <br />
Figure 13.4: <i>The state of HistoryManager after command "undo"</i>
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" style="width: 95%"> <br />
Figure 13.5: <i>A sequence diagram for an <code>undo</code> command</i>
</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `HistoryManager#redo()`, which executes the command `currentIndex` is pointing to, and decrements the `currentIndex` by one.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list recipes`.
Commands that do not modify the model, such as `list recipes`, will not be stored by the `HistoryManager` as they cannot be undone.
Since the `currentIndex` is not pointing to the end of the `CommandHistory` list, all commands starting from the `currentIndex` will be cleared, which in this case is the `add recipe beef noodles` command.

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/dg/state/UndoRedoState4.png"> <br />

</div>

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

Figure 13.7: <i>An activity diagram for the undo/redo feature</i>
</div>

<h4>Design considerations</h4>

**Aspect: How state is saved.**

- **Option A (current choice):** Save each undoable command as it is executed. Each command implements its own undo/redo operation.
  - Pros: Uses less memory since the entire state of the application does not have to be saved, and is also faster since only a small part of the model needs to be modified each time.
  - Cons: All model changes need to be restricted to the command, as each command needs to be able to fully reverse any changes made to the model.

- **Option B:** Saves the entire recipe/ingredient book every time a change is made to the model.
  - Pros: Easy to implement, does not require custom undo/redo operations for each command.
  - Cons: Will be much slower as the entire model needs to be replaced on each undo/redo, which does not scale well with more recipes/ingredients.

## C&ensp;Effort

With 10 being the baseline of AB3, we estimate the effort required to deliver the current version of ChopChop at **18**.


### C.1&ensp;Major Implementation Efforts

These are the components which have involved significant effort on our part to (re)implement, including significant new features as well as improvements and extensions to existing AB3 features.

#### C.1.1&ensp;GUI
The GUI of ChopChop was designed to provide a seamless User Experience(UX) for our users; besides adding data to ChopChop, our users are likely to be operating ChopChop while cooking. As such, our User Interface(UI) is designed to handle both mouse and cli inputs to enable users to navigate the application with ease regardless the setting. This design diverges vastly from AB3's non-switchable pane, non-resizable, cli only dark-themed design.

In addition, ChopChop's "tab" switching and resizable display ensures that our users have no issues viewing the information they need. This implementation of the GUI, as well as making the colors, fonts and shapes to mesh well together into a welcoming cooking application required significant hours of trial-and-error.

#### C.1.2&ensp;Command Parser
In order to fit the required behaviour of ChopChop (strictly ordered parameters, unnamed parameters) and to reduce pointless enterprise-style OOP, AB3's command parser was rewritten using a different paradigm. This involved a non-trivial amount of effort, and the new implementation was designed to interface with the (then-existing) AB3 code in the rest of the application.

In addition, a comprehensive set of tests were written for each command parser to achieve close to 100% code coverage for the parser.


#### C.1.3&ensp;Statistics and Recommendations
The development of the statistics feature follows a depth-first approach because it requires additional classes and operations across all major components in ChopChop.
Likewise, the recipe recommendations feature spans across all major components in ChopChop. It uses existing data structures such as `FilteredList` to compute its recommendations.

#### C.1.4&ensp;Automated GUI Testing
To ensure that our ChopChop GUI conform to its expected behaviour, we implemented Unit tests that test the individual components components comprehensively.

Thanks to the TestFX library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.



#### C.1.5&ensp;Tab Completion
To ensure ease of use and reduce typing tedium for potential users, PE testers, and ourselves during manual testing, tab completion was deemed to be an important aspect of the CLI-nature of ChopChop from the beginning, although it was only implemented in version 1.3.

Significant effort was undertaken to ensure that the completer works in all cases, including within the help command, and is able to provide contextually-appropriate completions (eg. providing ingredient names after `/ingredient`). Furthermore, this component is also comprehensively tested, with a near 100% code coverage as well.


#### C.1.6&ensp;Command History
To ensure that any mistakes that the user make are not permanent, an undo/redo feature is implemented so that any changes made to ChopChop can be easily reverted.

Effort was made to ensure that implementing the undo/redo feature for new commands is as straightforward as possible, through the use of an `Undoable` interface.


### C.2&ensp;Minor Implementation Efforts

These are components that are either straightforward extensions of existing AB3 features, or new features that were not extremely hard or intensive to implement.

#### C.2.1&ensp;Storage and Model Updates
The structures of both Model and Storage components remain mostly similar. Additional classes are added to support saving of Entry, Usage and new data structures in-memory and in json format. Superclasses are used wherever possible to reduce code duplication.

#### C.2.2&ensp;Utility Classes
A set of utility classes, namely `Pair`, `Result`, and `Either` were written to facilitate a functional programming style in various ChopChop components. These classes are comprehensively tested and well-documented as well.
