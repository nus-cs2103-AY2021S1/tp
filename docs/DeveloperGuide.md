## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram2.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`,  `OrderListPanel`,  `VendorListPanel` `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The `UI` component has two modes, the Vendor mode and the Menu mode. 

- If `Model#getVendorIndex()`  is -1 (default value), the `UI` will be in Vendor mode, otherwise, the `UI` will be in Menu mode.
- The mode can be updated using `MainWindow#updateMode()`.
- In Vendor mode, the `VendorListPanel` will be displayed to the user and the `FoodListPanel` will be hidden.
- In Menu mode, the `FoodListPanel` will be displayed to the user and the `VendorListPanel` will be hidden.



### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram2.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `SupperStrikersParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an order item).
1. The command execution can affect the `Storage` (e.g saving a preset).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `UI` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
1. The `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `UI` to re-render the menu when some commands such as `SortCommand` and `FindCommand`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remove 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remove 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `RemoveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram2.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* contains the `VendorManager` and `MenuManager`, `OrderManager` components.
    * `VendorManager` stores the data for vendors.
    * `MenuManager` stores the data for food items of the vendor's menu.
    * `OrderManager` stores the data for order items.

* Each of these components exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram2.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the vendor book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the `Preset` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `Profile` object in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Menu Commands

Menu commands represent the operations with which the users can interact with the menu.


#### Find Command

- The Find Command allows the user to find items in the menu of their selected vendor `Model#updateFilteredMenuItemList()`.
- If a vendor has not been selected, a `CommandException will be thrown`.


The following diagram summarises the sequence when the MenuCommand is executed.

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the FindCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with vendor i.

Step 2: The user enters the command `find Milo` which finds and displays all the items in the selected menu with Milo in their names.

Step 3: `Model#updateFilteredMenuItemList()` is executed to filter the current menu to only contain items that have the string "Milo" in their names.


#### Menu Command

- The Menu Command allows the user to view the default menu of their selected vendor `Model#showDefaultMenu`.
- If a vendor has not been selected, a `CommandException will be thrown`.


The following diagram summarises the sequence when the MenuCommand is executed.

![MenuCommandSequenceDiagram](images/MenuCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the FindCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with vendor i.

Step 2: The user enters the command `find Milo` which finds and displays all the items in the selected menu with Milo in their names.

Step 3: The user enters the command `menu` to display the selected menu with all the items.

Step 4: `Model#showDefaultMenu()` is executed to retrieve and display the selected menu. 


#### Sort Command

- The Sort Command allows the user to sort the selected menu based on price or name in ascending or descending order.
- If a vendor has not been selected, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
- If the parameters inputted are invalid, a `ParseException will be thrown`.


The following diagram summarizes the sequence when the Sort Command is executed.

![SortCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the SortCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with vendor i.

Step 2: The user enters the command `sort n a` which sorts the menu in ascending alphabetical order based on their names.

Step 3: SortCommand checks whether the parameters - ascending and name, inputted are valid. The parameters are valid.

Step 4: `Model#sortMenuItemBy()` is executed to sort the currently displayed menu in alphabetical ascending order of the menu item names.



### Order Commands

Order commands represents the operations to which users interact with.

#### Add Command

- The Add Command allows the user to add an order item from the selected menu `Model#getFilteredMenuItemList()`.
- If the index provided is greater than the size of the menu or less than equals to zero, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
- If the quantity provided is less than equals to zero, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
- If the resultant supper order's quantity added exceeds 100, a `CommandException will be thrown`.


The following diagram summarises the sequence when the AddCommand is executed.

![AddCommandDiagram](images/AddCommandDiagram.png)



Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AddCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time, by default, no vendor is selected.

Step 2: The user selects a vendor with the VendorCommand `vendor i`, the corresponding menu will be loaded.

Step 3: The user enters the command `add 2 3` which adds item 2 from the menu with a quantity of 3.

Step 4: `Model#getFilteredMenuItemList()` is executed to retrieve the list of menu items from the current vendor.

Step 5: `SupperStrikers` creates an AddCommandParser and calls `AddCommandParser#parse()` with argument "2 3".

Step 6: AddCommandParser checks whether the index and quantity inputted is valid. Index and Quantity is valid, then an AddCommand is created.

Step 7: An OrderItem object is created from the retrieved menu item and input quantity.

Step 8: `Model#addOrderItem()` is executed to add the OrderItem into the `Model`.



#### Remove Command

- The RemoveCommand allows the user to remove an order from his order list `Model#getObservableOrderItemList()`.
- If the index provided is greater than the size of his order list or less than or equal to zero, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
- If the quantity provided is less than equals to zero or greater than the current quantity, a `CommandException will be thrown`.



The following diagram summarises the sequence when the RemoveCommand is executed.

![RemoveCommandDiagram](images/RemoveCommandDiagram.png)


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the RemoveCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with `vendor i`.

Step 2: The user has added items with `add i qty`.

Step 3: The user enters the command `remove 1 1` which removes 1 quantity of the item at the 1st index in the order.

Step 4: `Model#getObservableOrderItemList()` is executed to retrieve the list of OrderItems from the current order.

Step 5: RemoveCommand checks whether the index and quantity inputted is valid. Index and Quantity is valid.

Step 6: A new OrderItem object is created from the retrieved OrderItem and input quantity.

Step 7: `Model#removeOrderItem()` is executed to remove the related OrderItem.



#### Clear Command

- The ClearCommand allows the user to clear all orders in the current order.
- If the current Order has no items, a `CommandException will be thrown`.



The following diagram summarises the sequence when the ClearCommand is executed.

![ClearCommandDiagram](images/ClearCommandDiagram.png)



Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ClearCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with `vendor i`.

Step 2: The user has added items with `add i qty`.

Step 3: The user enters the command `clear`.

Step 4: ClearCommand checks whether the order has OrderItems with `Model#getOrderSize()`. The order has OrderItems.

Step 5: `Model#clearOrder()` is executed to clear all OrderItems from the order.



#### Tag Command

 - The TagCommand allows the user to specify his preferences to an order item in the current order.
 - If the index provided is greater than the size of the user's order list or less than equals to zero, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
 - If the tag provided already exists, a `CommandException will be thrown`.


The following diagram summarizes the sequence when the TagCommand is executed. 
![TagCommandActivityDiagram](images/TagCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the TagCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with `vendor i`.

Step 2: The user has added items with `add i qty`.

Step 3: The user enters the command `tag 1 1 no ice` which adds the tag of "1 no ice" to the item at the first index in the order.

Step 4: `Model#getObservableOrderItemList()` is executed to retrieve the list of OrderItems from the current order.

Step 5: TagCommand checks whether the index and tag inputted is valid. Index and tag is valid.

Step 6: `Model#tagOrderItem()` is executed to tag the given OrderItem.


#### Untag Command

- The UntagCommand allows users to remove all tags from an order item in the current order.
- If the index provided is greater than the size of the user's order list or less than equals to zero, a `CommandException will be thrown`.

The following diagram summarizes the sequence when the TagCommand is executed. 
![UntagCommandActivityDiagram](images/UntagCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the UnTagCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with `vendor i`.

Step 2: The user has added items with `add i qty`.

Step 3: The user tagged the item at index 1 with `tag 1 all no ice`.

Step 4: The user enters the command `untag 1` to remove the tag of "all no ice" from the OrderItem at index 1.

Step 5: `Model#getObservableOrderItemList()` is executed to retrieve the list of OrderItems from the current order.

Step 6: UntagCommand checks whether the index inputted is valid. Index is valid.

Step 7: `Model#untagOrderItem()` is executed to remove all the tags that the given OrderItem has.



#### Preset Commands

- There are three types of preset commands, `preset save`, `preset load` `preset delete`.
- Preset save stores the current order in a file, with the given preset name under the specific vendor.
- Preset load retrieves the preset with the name provided from the user, and loads it into the current order.
- Preset delete deletes the preset with the name provided from the user.

- If the name given is invalid for preset commands, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
- If the name already exists for preset save, the previous file will be overwritten with the current one.
- Preset load retrieves the preset with the name provided from the file, and loads it into the current order.

The following sequence diagram summarises the sequence when the LoadPresetCommand is executed.

Step 2: The user enters the command `delete preset sample` to delete the preset named 'sample' stored in the user's presets json file.

Step 3: `Storage#readPresetManager()` is executed to retrieve the list of all presets, from the presets json file.

Step 4: The preset with the name `sample` for vendor `i` exists.

Step 5: `sample` is removed from the vendor index `i` position of `allLists`.

Step 6: `Storage#savePresetManager()` is executed to save the modified `allLists` into the `presets` json file.



Given below is the activity diagram for SavePresetCommand.

![SavePresetCommandActivityDiagram](images/SavePresetCommandActivityDiagram.png)



### Undo feature

Changes made to the Order can be undone by using the `undo` command.

The OrderManager starts out with a Stack of Order `orderHistory` and a main Order `order`, which
represents the past versions of the order, and the most current order respectively. Any changes (ie. `add`, `remove`,
`clear` etc.) should be done to `order`. After the changes are done, the method `OrderManager#saveChanges()` should be
called, which saves a copy (see `Order#makeCopy()`) of `order` to the `orderHistory`. If the user requests an undo,
the head of `orderHistory` will be popped, and `order` is now a copy of the head of the popped stack.

`OrderManager#saveChanges()` works based on the assumption that the head of `orderHistory` is always equal to `order`.
If not and a change is made to the order followed by calling `OrderManager#saveChanges()`, then the `order` right before 
the change is not saved. Therefore, the method `orderHistory#clear()` should not be called unless the developer 
understands the effect of doing so. This also means if a method changes the order and it should be able to be undone, 
`saveChanges()` must be called at the end of the method.

### Friendly Syntax

The friendly syntax allows users to type in just the prefix of a command to execute it.

The following diagram summarizes the sequence when the RemoveCommand is executed from the user input of `r 1`.

![Friendly_Syntax_Architecture_Diagram](images/friendly_syntax_architecture_diagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the friendly syntax behaves at the parse stage.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time and enters the vendor command `vendor 1`.

Step 2: SupperStrikers loads the menu of the 1<sup>st</sup> vendor into the GUI.

Step 3: The user enters the add command `add 1 3` 

Step 4:  SupperStrikers adds 3 of the 1<sup>st</sup> item into the order.

Step 5: The user enters the command `r 1 1`.

Step 6: The `LogicManager#execute()` is executed to call the `SupperStrikersParser#parseCommand()` method.

Step 7: `SupperStrikersParser#parseCommand()` checks if the inputted command word is a prefix of one and only one of the valid commands by filtering the list of valid commands based on whether they start with the user inputted prefix. The `r` in this case maps to the `remove` keyword.

Step 8: The `RemoveCommand` is executed and one quantity of the first item in the order is removed.  

- If there is no command with the given prefix, an `ParseException` will be thrown.
- If the inputted prefix exists for more than 1 command, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
- If there is a command which is a prefix for another command, it can no longer be executed.

### Vendor Commands

- There are two VendorCommand classes in SupperStrikers.
- `SwitchVendorCommand` allows the user to select a vendor from the `VendorManager` to order from.
- `VendorCommand`, deselects the vendor to the default unintialized value.

- If the vendor does not exist, a `CommandException will be thrown`.
- If the vendor selected is different from the current vendor, the model will clear the current order.


#### Switch Vendor Command
The following activity diagram summarises the process when the SwitchVendorCommand is executed.
<img src="images/SwitchVendorCommandActivityDiagram.png" alt="SwitchVendorCommandActivityDiagram" style="zoom:40%;" />





Given below is an example usage scenario and how the SwitchVendorCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time, by default, no vendor is selected.

Step 2: The user enters the vendor command `vendor i`.

Step 3: `Model#getObservableVendorList()` is executed to retrieve the list of vendors.

Step 4: SwitchVendorCommand checks whether i<sup>th</sup> index is valid.

Step 5: If the i<sup>th</sup> index is valid, `Model#selectVendor(i)` is executed to select the vendor. 

Step 6: Supper Strikers loads the menu of the i<sup>th</sup> vendor into the UI by calling `MainWindow#handleVendor()`.

Step 7: The UI component showing the vendor list is hidden and the UI showing the menu is displayed to the user by calling
`MainWindow#displayMenu()`.

Step 8: `Model#resetOrder()` creates a new empty order for the i<sup>th</sup> vendor.



The following diagram summarises the sequence when the SwitchVendorCommmand is executed.

<img src="images/VendorCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="VendorSequenceDiagram" style="zoom: 80%;" />

#### Vendor Command

Given below is an example usage scenario and how VendorCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user has selected a vendor with index `i`.

Step 2: The user enters the vendor command `vendor`.

Step 3:  `Model#selectVendor(-1)` is executed to set the vendor to the default uninitialized value.

Step 4: The UI component showing the menu is hidden and the UI component showing the vendor list is displayed to the 
user by calling `MainWindow#displayMenu()`.

Step 5: `Model#resetOrder()` sets the order to a new empty order.
