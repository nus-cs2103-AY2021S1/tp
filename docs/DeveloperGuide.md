## **Introduction**

Momentum is a desktop app that helps freelancers track time spent on different projects and gain insights on how their time is spent.

It is designed for people that prefer typing, so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

This developer guide provides information about the architecture and implementation of Momentum. It gives developers interested in developing Momentum a good start in knowing how the application works, without going too much into the lower level details. It also provides information for testers on how to test the product.

**:information_source: Some things to take note of in this guide:**<br>

* When a notation like `Foo#bar` is used (e.g. "The method `Foo#bar` is called...") it refers too the `bar` method from the `Foo` class.
* Method references made in this document will only include arguments if relevant to what is being explained.
* The lifeline for sequence diagrams should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

## **Design**

### Architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` when in project view.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TrackedItemListPanel`, `BottomBar` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Various UI parts such as `TrackedItemCard`, `TimerCard`, `PieChartCard` listen for changes to `Model` data so that they can be updated with the modified data.
* `MainWindow` has an association to `Logic` as it will call on `Logic` to fetch certain data for the some of the UI parts such as `StatCard`.

### Logic Component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ProjectBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a project).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call when in project view.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Model Component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:

* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObjectProperty<ObservableList<TrackedItem>>` that stores the projects or tasks that are currently displayed to the user.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TrackedItems>` that stores projects or tasks that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TrackedItems>` that stores the total projects or tasks with running timers that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

Packages in the `Model`:

* The `project` package contains classes representing a `Project` and `Task` that can be added by a user under a project, such that a project can have a list of tasks.
Both `Project` and `Task` extend `TrackedItem`.
* A `Project` can store multiple `Task` objects.
* The `project` package also contains `UniqueItemList<TrackedItem>` which is a list of unique projects, or a list of unique tasks.

### Storage Component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/momentum/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `JsonAdaptedProject` objects in `JsonSerializableProjectBook` in json format and read it back.

The `JsonAdaptedProject` class contains the same fields as the `JsonAdaptedTask` class.
In addition to the fields in `JsonAdaptedTask` component, `JsonAdaptedProject` also contains a taskList in `List<JsonAdaptedTask>` format, as show in the class diagram above.

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.momentum.commons` package. These classes contain methods or data used by various components and serve as a single source of such methods and data.

Notable classes in this package include:

* `Clock`: Acts as a consistent, single source of the 'current time' within the application
* `DateWrapper`, `TimeWrapper`, `DateTimeWrapper`: Represents dates and times within Momentum, with utility methods to calculate the dates and times required by various parts of the application.
* `UniqueItem`, `UniqueItemList`: Represents a list of unique items that are compared using a specially defined identity instead of the standard `equals()` method.
* `GuiWindowSettings`: Manages the GUI window size and position settings.
* `GuiThemeSettings`: Manages the GUI theme settings that can be changed by the user.
* `StatisticTimeFrame`, `StatisticTimeFrameSettings`: Manages the statistics settings that can be changed by the user.

There are also classes with useful utility methods used to handle different types of data, such as dates, times, strings, json and files.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding Tasks to Projects

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

In Momentum, each project can contain a list of tasks. These can use used to represent various sub-tasks that the user needs to do as part of the project. This section will explain how this is implemented, and some alternative implementations that we have considered.

#### Chosen Implementation: Separate Task and Project

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

Both projects and tasks have many similarities. They share the following fields:

* Name
* Description
* Completion Status
* Reminder
* Deadline
* Created Date
* Tags

Additionally, both projects and tasks need to work with Momentum's time tracking and statistics features.
Therefore, it is reasonable to have an abstract `TrackedItem` class that contains the fields and methods shared by both projects and tasks, and have `Project` and `Task` extend from it.

Projects and tasks will then have fields and methods for the behaviours unique to each item. Specifically, a project will contain a list of tasks, and have methods that allow it to modify its own list of tasks. This results in the  structure illustrated by the class diagram below:

![ProjectTaskClassDiagram](images/ProjectTaskClassDiagram.png)

This allows us to take advantage of polymorphism to ensure that every command will work with both projects and tasks, without having to provide separate implementations for each.

Below is an object diagram to illustrate an example of the structure of some projects and tasks being tracked by Momentum:

![ProjectTaskObjectDiagram](images/ProjectTaskObjectDiagram.png)

The `view` and `home` commands allow users to navigate between viewing a single project's tasks, and a view of all projects (with their tasks not visible).

This is implemented by having a list of tracked items to be shown to the user, `itemList`. This list is changed to be the project's task list when a `view` command is executed, and changed to the overall project list when a `home` command is executed. The list can then be further sorted using the [sort command](#sort-command) or filtered using the [find command](#find-command), to form a separate list, `displayList`, that is provided to the UI components to be   displayed to the user.

Most of the commands in Momentum thus become context sensitive, behaving differently depending on whether the project list is being viewed, or a task list if being viewed. For example, the `add` command would add a project if the user  is viewing the project list, but if the user is viewing a specific project's task list, it will add a task to that project instead.

We have identified the following benefits and drawbacks of this implementation.

Benefits:

* Having a `TrackedItem` parent class gives us the opportunity to easily extend Momentum to track other things beyond projects and tasks, while also making it easier to integrate new items with existing commands.
* Having a clear difference between `Project` and `Task` classes allows us to further differentiate projects and tasks in the future. Additional task or project specific features can be easily added without affecting the other.

Drawbacks:

* Some type casting is required for certain operations on projects and tasks, especially for testing purposes. While this is not neccessarily a bad thing, it may make the code less readable and harder to follow.

#### Alternative Implemention: Using Predicates

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

Another implementation we considered was to add all `Project` and `Task` objects to the same `UniqueItemsList`.

This implementation shares some similarities with our chosen implementation. Both `Project` and `Task` will extend an abstract `TrackedItem` class.

However, it differs in the way the `displayList` is updated.

A rough summary of the proposed implementation is as follows:

* There will be two predicates. The first predicate will be used to check whether an object is a project or a task. The second predicate will be the normal predicate used to filter the list in the find command.
* Changes in view will modify the first predicate.
* Using the find command will modify the second predicate.
* The predicate used to determine the entries shown in the `displayList` is the logical AND of the first and second predicates.

We have identified the following benefits and drawbacks of this implementation.

Benefits:

* This implementation is much simpler than having to maintain a separate list of `Task` objects for each project. It is likely that existing commands would not have to be changed as much.

Drawbacks:

* A bi-directional association between projects and tasks will be needed. This is unnecessary as a project is composed of multiple tasks. Tasks do not need to know which project they are a part of.
* It might be harder and more time-consuming to write rigorous tests for this implementation.

#### Alternative Implementation: Projects can contain Projects

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

Since projects and tasks are so similar, it may make more sense to treat them as the same object in the first place. Therefore, it is possible to model a project's sub-tasks as projects themselves. This results in a structure where each project can contain a list of other projects, as illustrated below:

![ProjectInProjectClassDiagram](images/ProjectInProjectClassDiagram.png)

We have identified the following benefits and drawbacks of this implementation.

Benefits:

* This implementation is much simpler than having to maintain separate `Project` and `Task` classes. It is likely that existing commands would not have to be changed as much.
* Projects can contain not just sub-projects, but sub-sub-projects, sub-sub-sub-projects, etc, allowing for deeper nesting of projects. This may be useful for users to manage more complex project structures.

Drawbacks:

* We will be unable to differentiate between a project and sub-project, since they are both modeled as the same class. This means that project or sub-project specific features cannot be easily implemented without affecting the other.
* Allowing for deeper nesting of projects may make the application more confusing to use without significant UI changes.

### Immutability

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

`Projects`, `Tasks`, `Timers`, and `WorkDurations` are immutable. This means that anytime a project's details are changed, a new object is created with the new details, and the model is updated with the new object.

Notable examples include:

* Starting/Stopping a Timer: A new object is created with the updated timer state and durations.
* Editing a Project: A new object is created with the new project's details, with the same timer and durations recorded.

Below is an example of what happens when a project's timer is stopped:

![StopTimerSequenceDiagram](images/StopTimerSequenceDiagram.png)

In this case, since the project's timer is being changed, new `TimerWrapper`, `WorkDuration`, `UniqueDurationList` objects are created, which are then used to create a new `Project`, which is subsequently used to replace the old `Project` in the model.

We chose to implement projects this way as immutability makes these classes more easily testable, and also to support [undo and redo commands](#undoredo-feature).

### Timers and Durations

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

Momentum allows users to track the time that they spend on each project and task. Time tracking is done by starting and stopping a timer using the `start` and `stop` commands. The period of time that the user spends is then stored as a `WorkDuration` object.

The below diagram illustrates the structure of the classes used for timetracking, and how they are used to calculate [statistics](#statistics).

 ![TimerDurationClassDiagram](images/TimerDurationClassDiagram.png)

Each project/task has a `TimerWrapper` that represents a timer that can track the time spent on that project. The timer can be started and stopped by the user using the `start`/`stop` commands.

The timer does not run actively (counting each second/millisecond), instead it records the time when it was started, and the time when it was stopped.  This implementation was chosen because it allows Momentum's timers to continue running even when the application is
closed, by saving the timer's start/stop times together with project/task data.

We chose to give each project and task its own timer as that allows Momentum to support running multiple timers concurrently, one for each project/task, for users that want to multi-task.

A `WorkDuration` represents a period of time that the user spent working on a project. Each `Project` contains a list of `WorkDuration` that represents each time the each the user starts and stops the timer for the project.

We chose to do this implementation to allow for flexibility in calculating statistics.

### Deadlines

Done by Cheong Ying Yi Clara

#### Implementation of Deadline Class

The deadline of a project and tasks is implemented using `DateWrapper` and `TimeWrapper`. The `dateWrapper` and `timeWrapper` is stored as `Optional<DateWrapper>` and `Optional<TimeWrapper>` in the `Deadline` class.

Since both date and time is optional in the class, a deadline is empty when both `dateWrapper` and `timeWrapper` is empty. An empty deadline can be created easily without `TrackedItem` needing to know whether it has a deadline. This design was chosen due to the ease of implementation. Another reason is because no dummy data will be required.

#### Alternative Implementation: Store Date and Time using `DateTimeWrapper`

An alternative design is to store date and time in a `DateTimeWrapper` with dummy date and time if the date or time is not present as `LocalDateTime` requires both date and time. However, extra checks will have to be done to differentiate between dummy and actual data.

#### Parsing a Deadline

The date and time of a deadline of a project or task is parsed separately using different prefixes. This design is chosen as date and time is stored separately and the format of date and time can be more flexible.

#### Alternative Implementation: Parsing Date and Time Together

An alternative design is to parse both date and time together. This is harder to implement as date and time is stored separately in deadline. This design would also restrict the format of the date and time.

#### Constraints of a Deadline

The deadline has to be on or after the created date. This is checked when the `Deadline` is instantiated. This constraint has been added so that more meaningful statistics can be generated.

For `EditCommand`, a descriptor of type `editTrackedItemDescriptor` containing edited fields is created directly from parsing the user input in `EditCommandParser`, hence the created date is unknown. A dummy date using `LocalDate.EPOCH` is passed into the constructor of `Deadline` in `EditCommandParser` to allow creation of the deadline. The check that deadline has to be on or after the created date is done in the `getUpdatedDeadline` method of `EditCommand` class after the created date of the project to be edited is known.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the Edit Project Command with Deadline](images/EditDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png)

### Reminders

Done by Cheong Ying Yi Clara

Users can add reminders to be notified on particular projects or tasks at the date and time specified.

Reminders are stored in a project or task. The reminder run and shows the name of the project or task in the reminder panel of the sidebar at the date and time while the application is opened. Reminders are removed after a reminder is runned at the specified date and time.

If application is not open at the date and time of the reminder or if there are multiple reminders scheduled at the same date and time, the reminder will be marked as missed. Details on how the reminder will be marked as missed is in the [Scheduling of Reminders](#scheduling-of-reminders) section.

#### Organisation of Reminder Related Classes

The reminder is stored as a `Reminder` class in a project or task. The date and time of a reminder is stored in `Reminder`.

`ReminderManager` schedules the reminder using the `schedule` method of the `Timer` class and runs the reminder using the `run` method of the `ThreadWrapper` class.

The diagram below shows the structure of the classes related to the `reminder` package.

![Structure of the Model Component for Reminders](images/ReminderClassDiagram.png)

More details on the implementation of `ReminderManager` is given in the [Scheduling of Reminders](#scheduling-of-reminders) section.

#### Alternative Implementation: Manage Reminders using `Reminder` Class

An alternative would be to schedule and run the reminder in `Reminder` class directly. This design was not chosen as that `Reminder` would have to contain references to both `Model` and `ProjectBook`, which is undesired as the projects and tasks in the `ProjectBook` will have to be modified.

#### Rescheduling Reminders

Whenever a project or task is added, edited or removed, the reminders needs to be adjusted accordingly. The chosen implementation is to reschedule all the reminders. This is done through `Model#rescheduleReminders` which is further explained in the [Scheduling of Reminders](#scheduling-of-reminders) section.

#### Alternative Implementation: Reschedule Reminders of Projects or Tasks Changed

An alternative would be to only reschedule projects or tasks that are affected by the change. This design was not chosen as it is more complicated and would increase the coupling between `ReminderManager` and other related classes.

#### Scheduling of Reminders

`ReminderManager` contains a reference to a `Model` so that the projects and tasks can be iterated through callback methods and the reminders of the projects can be modified.

To schedule reminders, several callback functions are used to iterate through the project book in the model. The entry point is in `ModelManager` where `rescheduleReminders` can be called.
This method calls `ReminderManager#rescheduleReminder` so that the `timer` in `ReminderManager` can be reseted before the reminders are actually scheduled.

After resetting the `timer`, reminders are rescheduled by calling
`Model#rescheduleReminder`. This method iterates through the project book through `ProjectBook#rescheduleReminder` to modify the projects and tasks. In this method, the expiration of the reminders will be updated through `ProjectBook#updateExpiredReminders` before the reminder of each project and task is rescheduled as shown in the diagram below.

![Schedule Reminder Sequence Diagram](images/ScheduleReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

![Update Expired Reminders Sequence Diagram](images/ScheduleReminderSequenceDiagramUpdateExpiredReminders.png)

![Reschedule Reminder of a Project Sequence Diagram](images/ScheduleReminderSequenceDiagramRescheduleReminderProject.png)

`ReminderManager` has an inner class `ReminderTimerTask` which implements `TimerTask` that is used to schedule a reminder with `Timer`. This design was chosen as `ReminderTimerTask` references non-static methods of `ReminderMananger` as well as `Model`, which is also referenced in `ReminderManager`. More details on how the reminders are runned using `ReminderTimerTask` is given in the [Running Reminders](#running-reminders) section

#### Alternative Implementation: Implement `ReminderTimerTask` as a Separate Class

An alternative implementation is to implement `ReminderTimerTask` as a separate class. With this implementation, `ReminderTimerTask` will have to contain extra references such as `ReminderManager` and `Model`.

#### Running Reminders

At the date and time scheduled, the reminder will be run.

In the process of running the reminders, the UI will show the reminder and it will be removed.

![Run Task Reminder Sequence Diagram](images/RunTaskReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

The result of the reminder is stored as a `StringProperty` in `ReminderManager`and retrieved from the `Model` so that a listener can be used in `MainWindow` to observe the `StringProperty` so that changes can be detected and the GUI can be updated acccordingly.

A `BooleanProperty` is also stored in `ReminderManager` to keep track of whether there are any reminders so that `MainWindow` can detect whether there are reminders and hide or show the reminder panel accordingly. This design was also chosen due to the ease of implementation.

### Statistics

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

Momentum calculates statistics using the time tracking data collected from [timers and durations](#timers-and-durations).
These statistics are implemented using the command design pattern, similar to how Commands are implemented. Each statistic tracked by Momentum is represented by a `Statistic` object, and a `StatisticManager` contains all the statistics and is responsible for updating them whenever the model is changed.

Each statistic exposes a `calculate(Model model)` method that is called by the `StatisticManager` to calculate or update the data with the information in the model. The method contains instructions on how that particular statistic is calculated.

For example, the `PeriodicTotalTimeStatistic` calculates the amount of time the user
spends on each project within a specified [timeframe](#timeframes), and is calculated by looking at each project in the model and summing up all the durations spent working on the project for the given timeframe.

The statistics data is stored in each `Statistic` object as one or more `StatisticEntry` objects. A `StatisticEntry` represents a unit statistics data, which contains a `label` describing the data and the data's `value`.

Below is a sequence diagram to demonstrate how the statistics for time spent per project (weekly) is calculated and how the data is retrieved.

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Timeframes

Momentum currently supports calculating statistics within the following timeframes:
* **Daily**: The period between midnight of the previous day, to the current time.
* **Weekly**: The period between midnight of the Monday of that week, to the current time.
* **Monthly**: The period between midnight of the 1st day of the month, to the current time.

The timeframe used to calculate statistics can be [set by the user](#settings).

### Managing Time

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

The `Clock` class acts as a consistent, single source of the current time within the application, and provides the  option to manually set and control the current time for testing purposes. Objects that need to know the current time must obtain it from `Clock`.

The `Clock` class has 3 modes that allow for it to perform different functions:

* **Normal**: The normal system time is returned.
* **Fixed**: The same, preset time is always returned. Used for testing purposes.
* **Manual**: The passage of time can be manually controlled, such as fast-forwarding and rewinding time by specific  amounts. Used for testing purposes.

This implementation was chosen because it allows all time-related features to be more easily testable.

#### Alternative Implementation: Using `LocalDateTime.now()` directly

This implementation was considered but ultimately rejected as it introduced several problems in testing time-related features. Notable issues are:

 * It is impossible to check for equality when getting system time directly using `LocalDateTime.now()` and other similar methods, since time would always progress by a small amount between each call.
 * It is difficult to test features that require the passage of time, such as the `start` and `stop` commands as we would need to actually wait an amount of time during the tests.

Below are some activity diagrams to illustrate the process of obtaining the current time from `Clock` in the various modes:

| ![](images/ClockActivityDiagram1.png) | ![](images/ClockActivityDiagram2.png) | ![](images/ClockActivityDiagram3.png)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Normal|Fixed|Manual|

### Find Command

Momentum allows users to search for projects and tasks using the find command. Users can search for projects/tasks based on their name, description, tag and completion status. A FindType is included to determine whether any, all or none of the parameters need to match a project/task for it to be displayed.

#### Find Command Implementation

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

A predicate is created for each type of search parameter (name, description, tags, completion status). There are four predicates classes defined for this purpose.

* `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` - Filters for projects/tasks based on name.
* `DescriptionContainsKeywordPredicate` - Filters for projects/tasks based on description.
* `TagListContainsKeywordPredicate` - Filters for projects/tasks based on tags.
* `CompletionStatusPredicate` - Filters for projects/tasks based on completion status.

Each of these predicate classes extends the abstract `ContainsKeywordPredicate` class which implements the `Predicate` interface. Each of these predicate classes takes in a match type, represented by the enumeration `FindType`.

The `ContainsKeywordPredicate` has a `testPredicate` method that is used or overridden by the subclasses. This method is used to test predicates based on the `FindType`.

The following class diagram shows the structure of the aforementioned classes.

![PredicateClassDiagram](images/PredicateClassDiagram.png)

The `FindCommandParser` creates a list of predicates based on the arguments entered by the user. `FindCommandParser#combinePredicates` is then used to chain these predicates using the `Predicate#or` or `Predicate#and` methods depending on the `FindType` selected. This returns a `Predicate<TrackedItem> predicate`. The `FindCommand` will pass `predicate` into `Model#updatePredicate` to update the `displayList` once executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `FindCommandParser`works. Note that some details have been omitted from the diagram below for clarity.

![FindCommandParserSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Chaining Predicates based on Find Type

The process of creating and chaining predicates varies based on the `FindType` selected. The following activity diagrams show this process for the various `FindType`s.

| ![CombinePredicatesActivityDiagram](images/CombinePredicatesActivityDiagram.png)

Note that `FindType.NONE` uses the logical AND when combining predicates. This is because individual predicates test for a negative match result. These negative results need to be chained together using the logical AND because a negative match requires a project to not match every keyword.

This design was chosen as it built on the existing implementation of the find command, which passed a `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` to the `displayList`. This means that minimal changes to other parts of the project were required.

#### Behaviour of Find Command

The filter used on the `displayList` by the Find Command will be reset after the `Add` Command is used. It will however persist after using the `Edit` Command and `Delete` Command.

The list will not be filtered after using the `View` or `Home` Commands.

This implementation is chosen as we felt that it presents users with the best experience.

#### Alternative Implementation: Using a Custom Predicate Class

A custom predicate class is used to contain all predicates in a separate `MomentumPrediate` interface.

This implementation was ultimately rejected as it introduced unnecessary complexities with Predicate chaining. The `MomentumPredicate` interface will need to override `Predicate#and` and `Predicate#or` with our custom implementation.

### Settings

Done by Khoo De Hui

Currently, Momentum allows the GUI theme and the statistics timeframe to be adjusted by the user. This is done using the set command.

#### Set Command

The command works by first creating and filling up a `SettingsToChange` object with the settings given by the user, and then identifying what will be changed. The necessary methods in `Model` such as `setGuiThemeSettings` or `setStatisticTimeframeSettings` will be called to update the settings.

The settings changed by the user will also reflect immediately in the application. This is handled by [`SettingsUpdateManager`](#settings-update-manager), which is called during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the set command works.
![SetCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SetCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Updating and Saving User Prefs

Settings are saved by updating `GuiThemeSettings` and/or `StatisticTimeframeSettings` in `UserPrefs` in the application model. All class attributes in `UserPrefs` are serializable, so that all settings in `UserPrefs` can be saved in `preferences.json` when the user exits the application. Serialization is done using `JsonUserPrefsStorage#saveUserPrefs`.

Below is the class diagram of `UserPrefs`.

![UserPrefsClassDiagram](images/UserPrefsClassDiagram.png)

Model manager will call on `UserPrefs#returnChangedGuiThemeSettings` or `UserPrefs#returnChangedStatisticTimeframeSettings` when updating the settings. Notice that the two methods will return a new `UserPrefs`. This design is chosen so as to support [`Undo/Redo`](#undoredo-feature), where versions can be placed on the different instances of `UserPrefs`.

#### Settings Update Manager

`SettingsUpdateManager` is a class that assists in updating the application instance with the new settings when there are changes made to `UserPrefs`.

Currently, the user adjustable settings are the GUI theme and the timeframe of the statistics shown. Hence, `SettingsUpdateManager` takes in a `Ui`, and a `StatisticGenerator` as attributes in order to update them.

`SettingsUpdateManager#updateTheme` and `SettingsUpdateManager#updateStatisticTimeFrame` are designed to handle null cases of `Ui` and `StatisticGenerator` so as to make testing more convenient. This is because there are methods being tested that will indirectly call the above methods. Allowing `Ui` and `StatisticGenerator` to be null will enable them to not be instantiated in the tests.

It is also worth noting that all attributes and methods in `SettingUpdateManager` are class-level instead of instance-level. This design was chosen so as to allow minimal changes to the code base. However, one con of this design will be that the attributes and methods can be set or called from anywhere in the code.

#### Alternative Implementation of `SettingsUpdateManager`

An alternative implemention of `SettingsUpdateManager` is to convert all of the class-level attributes and methods to become instance-level. While this can address the con mentioned above, having to pass an instantiated `SettingsUpdateManager` object around now will require some undesirable changes to be made. Below describe the possible ways to pass a `SettingsUpdateManager` object around and it's undesired effects.

* Include `SettingsUpdateManager` as an attribute in `ModelManager`:
  * As `Model` is only meant to hold data of the app, putting `SettingUpdateManager` in `ModelManager` is not ideal.
* Include `SettingsUpdateManager` as an attribute in `LogicManager`:
  * With the current code design, in order for `SetCommand` to be able to use `SettingsUpdateManager`, it is required that `SettingsUpdateManager` is passed in as an argument in `SetCommand#execute` when the method is called by `LogicManager`. This will require changes to be made to the abstract `Command` superclass' `execute` method, and is also an undesirable design as all commands will now be aware of `SettingsUpdateManager` when `SetCommand` is the only command using it.

#### Alternative Implementation of Settings Feature

An alternative way to implement the settings feature is to not make the settings reflect immediately. Instead, the user will have to restart the application for the settings to take effect. While it will be much easier to implement since it will only require updating `UserPrefs`, it will not provide a good user experience.

### Sort Command

Done by Kang Su Min

Momentum allows users to sort their list of projects/tasks using sort command. The following sort types and orders are available:

Sort Type

 * `SortType.ALPHA`: sort the list of projects/tasks in alphabetical order.
 * `SortType.DEADLINE`: sort the list of projects/tasks according to their deadlines.
 * `SortType.CREATED`: sort the list of projects/tasks according to their date of creation.
 * `SortType.NULL`: sort type not specified by user, sort the list of projects/tasks according to the current sort type.

 Sort Order

 * Ascending order
 * Descending order

 Sort By Completion Status

 * On: First sort by placing projects/tasks with incomplete status at the top of the list then sorting by specified sort type and order
 * Off: Sort projects/tasks by specified sort type and order without regard for completion status.

The comparators below facilitate the ordering of the list of projects/tasks.

* `CompletionStatusCompare` - Comparator that compares the completion status of two tasks. This is a comparator that imposed a sort order on top of other comparators, which means that all incomplete projects/tasks are shown at the top of the list ordered in the specified orders, and all complete projects/tasks are shown at the bottom, also ordered in the specified order. This sort order is imposed by default, and can be toggled on and off.
* `CreatedDateCompare` - Comparator that compares the created date of two tasks, then the alphabetical names of two tasks if created dates are the same.
* `NameCompare` - Comparator that compares the alphabetical names of two tasks.
* `DeadlineCompare` - Comparator that compares the deadlines of two tasks, then the alphabetical names of two tasks if deadlines are the same.

#### Design Details

* The `SortCommandParser` parses user input and passes sort values (Sort type, whether it is in ascending order, whether the default ordering of completion status) to the `ModelManager`.
* The comparators are then generated according to these values in `ModelManager` and sort order is imposed on the list of projects/tasks based on the comparator. `ModelManager` stores the information of the latest sort order imposed so that the sort order can be maintained.

* All comparators extend the class `Comparator<TrackedItem>` except `DeadlineCompare`, which extends the class `Comparator<HashMap<String, Object>>`.
  * This is because for all other attributes such as name, completion status and created date, it is guaranteed that every `TrackedItem` will have a non-null value, however it is possible that a project or a task has no deadline.
  * Therefore, `Comparator#nullsLast` was used to place the project/tasks with no deadlines at the end of the list if the list is to be sorted by deadline. Those with deadlines will then be compared by passing in their deadline and name details to a `HashMap` which is then compared using `DeadlineCompare`, while those without deadlines will be sorted in alphabetical order using `NameCompare`.

#### Alternative Implementation: Making `TrackedItem` extend `Comparable`

This implementation was initially considered at the start before developing the sort feature further to include different sort types and sort orders.
However, this was not as appropriate for usage due to the following reasons:

* Making `TrackedItem` extend `Comparable<TrackedItem>` would not allow for advanced, multi-level sort feature that we have now as it would only be sorted in one particular order.
* In the case of deadline, some tasks/projects do not have them, and it would not be possible to sort projects/tasks using `Comparable<TrackedItem>`.

### Undo/Redo Feature

Done by Kang Su Min

The undo/redo command allows users to step through their history log of Momentum, such that they can undo commands they have excecuted wrongly, or redo commands that they have previously undone.

#### Chosen Implementation

The undo/redo implementation is as such:

 * Create a `VersionedProjectBook` which extends `ProjectBook` with an undo/redo history log
 * The history of `VersionedProjectBook` is stored as a `projectBookStateList` containing versions of `ProjectBookWithUi` and a `currentStatePointer`. Users are able to go back to a particular point in their history log by shiting the `currentStatePointer`.
    * The need for an additional class `ProjectBookWithUi` comes from the need to store UI details that need to be reset in `ModelManager` class in addition to the resetting of `ProjectBook` data done by undo/redo within `VersionedProjectBook` class.
 The `VersionedProjectBook` implements the following operations to facilitate the storing and traversing of history:

* `VersionedProjectBook#commit()` — Saves the current project book state in its `projectBookStateList` as a `ProjectBookWithUi` object.
* `VersionedProjectBook#undo()` — Resets the project book data with data from the previous project book state in its history.
* `VersionedProjectBook#redo()` — Resets the project book data with data from a previously undone project book state in its history.

The above operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitToHistory()`, `Model#undoCommand()` and `Model#redoCommand()` respectively.

An example usage scenario has been provided below to demonstrate the undo/redo mechanism.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProjectBook` is initialized with the initial project book state, and the state is added to the `projectBookStateList` with the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 2` command to delete the 2nd project in the project book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitToHistory`, which adds the new state of the project book after the execution of `delete 2` command as `ProjectBookWithUi` in the `projectBookStateList`. After every new command (excluding undo, redo, and help), the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the most recent project book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Design Webpage for XYZ​` to add a new project. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`, which similarly adds the new state of the project book after the execution of `add n/Design Webpage for XYZ​` command as `ProjectBookWithUi` in the `projectBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If a command fails its execution, `Model#commitProjectBook()` is not called. Project book state will not be saved into the `projectBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. If user wants undo that action due to some errors in the information, they can do so by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command calls `Model#undoCommand()`, which resets the current project book with the data from the previous project book state. This is done after `currentStatePointer` is shifted once to the left.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, meaning there is no history to traverse back in time, then the `undo` command will throw an exception that informs user that there is no command to undo. This is done after checking that there is no history to go back to using `Model#canUndoCommand()`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> Help and Exit commands does not call `Model#commitProjectBook()` as these command will not cause any project book changes in terms of data or UI.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoCommand()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and resets the current project book with the data from the next project book state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `projectBookStateList.size() - 1`, meaning there is no history to move forward to (undo has not been executed), then the `redo` command will throw an exception that informs user that there is no command to redo. This is done after checking that there is no history to move forward to using `Model#canRedoCommand()`

</div>

Step 5. If the user changes their mind and decides that the error is minor and wish to redo the previously undone command, they can do so by executing the `redo` command. The `redo` command calls `Model#redoCommand()`, which resets the current project book with the data from the next project book state. This is done after `currentStatePointer` is shifted once to the right.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. If the user changes their mind once again and decides to go with undo, they can do so by executing the `undo` command again.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

Step 7. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProjectBook()`. Because the `currentStatePointer` is not the most recent state in `projectBookStateList`, all project book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be flushed. This is to maintain a single history of states based on executed commands.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState6.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command (that is not undo, redo, help, or exit):

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Alternative Implementation: Saving Commands Instead of Entire Project Book

This would allow users to go back in history through a reversal of command once a command is undone.

Because this stores a history of commands and versions of the entire project book, it takes up less memory in users' devices and as a result would have performance gains.

This was a candidate for implementation but ultimately rejected due to the following concerns:

* It is difficult to implement the reversal of every command.

  * We have added many new features and commands, hence it would take time to implement the reversal of each command. It would be wiser to spend the time on improving our existing features.

* This would be more prone to bugs due to the compulsory implementation of reversal of every command.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Freelancers
  * Freelancers may take on multiple projects simultaneously, so they need to manage and track the time they spend on each project.
  * Freelancers want to know how much time they spend on a project in order to accurately bill their clients and set future rates.
  * Freelancers might want to know more about how they distribute their time and track the time spent on each project so that they can better understand their working style, and plan their time more efficiently.

**Value proposition**:

* Time tracking app
  * Dashboard view for freelancer to get an overview of all projects.
  * Projects can contain multiple tasks to facilitate effective tracking of projects.
  * Use tags to organise tasks and projects for commonly used categories.
  * Timer to track the duration of a task or project, so that the user can price their rates and charge clients more accurately.
  * Deadline and completion status to track the status of a task or project.
  * Reminder for a project (only when application is open).
  * Perform highly customised searches for projects and tasks.
  * Quickly organise projects and tasks based on different parameters.
  * Attractive GUI with customisable themes for better user experience.
  * Interesting/creative views for visualizing the data.

## **Apendix: Effort** ##
This section gives an overview of the total effort put into the project, challenges faced, as well as the
achievements of the project.

### New Features
The following new features were implemented on top of AB3:

#### Tasks

While AB3 only managed 1 entity type (Persons), Momentum handles 2 entity types (Projects and Tasks). 
Additionally, the 2 entities are related, where each project can contain any number of tasks, which further increases the complexity.
Implementing this feature required major changes to all parts of the code base, as tasks needed to integrate well with both existing and new features. 
This also required us to make most commands context sensitive, so that they can handle different behaviours for Projects and Tasks, which required changes to the way commands are parsed and executed.

#### Time Tracking and Statistics

The time tracking and statistics features involved working with dates and times, which also increased the complexity of the application. 
The feature involved introducing the `WorkDuration` and `Statistic` entities, and additional code to manage and operate on them.
The UI was also improved to display timers and statistics in a visually pleasing yet comprehensible way. Testing time
related features was also difficult, but the team overcame this by allowing for manual control of time using the `Clock` class.

#### Reminders 

The implementation of reminders was particularly difficult since required the use of threads to schedule and run tasks at different times. 
In addition, the way threads are run in JavaFX applications are different form normal Java applications, since the JavaFX application itself runs on threads. 
This made it difficult to test the reminder functions. Hence we had to use other methods to switch between running on the JavaFX platform and running it normally, to allow for testing.

#### Sorting

While the team could have implemented a simple alphabetical sort, the team went an extra mile to implement sorting for other parameters (deadline, created date, completion status, etc) as well. 
The team also allowed for both ascending and descending sort. The implementation's complexity was further compounded by the fact that sort needed to work with undo/redo.

#### Undo/Redo

While AB3 provided a proposed implementation of an undo/redo feature, many changes had to be made to accomodate the new features and improvements introduced in Momentum. 
This meant that there were many additional considerations to be made, espcially with undoing and redoing UI related components.

### Enhancements to existing features
We have also made significant enhancements to the following existing AB3 features:

#### Find
The team improved upon the existing AB3 find features to allow for more flexibility. 
Users can not only find based on name, but also other parameters like description and tags. 
Users can also match any, all or none of the provided parameters, as opposed to AB3 where only matching all was available. 
The implementation involved an almost complete change in the way find was handled. Predicate chaining was utilized to handle all the possible find types. 
Additional code was written to handle the parsing of the user's commands to these predicates. The difficulty was compounded by the fact that it had to allow for undo/redo.

#### User Interface
The team conducted an overhaul of the AB3 UI. Since the new features implemented required much more data to be displayed to the user, it was challenging to design the UI in a way that allowed all the information to be shown while still being asthetically pleasing and user friendly. 
We added some customizability in the form of a light and dark theme. Most of the fxml code for existing UI elements were changed. Each theme also required new css stylesheets. Additional commands such as the `set`, `show` and `dismiss` commands were implemented to allow the user to change UI elements.
