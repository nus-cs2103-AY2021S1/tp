## **Introduction**

CAP5Buddy helps NUS SoC students to keep track of their module details efficiently. It helps them centralize key 
module details and follows their study progress through a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows efficient management 
of module details. CAP5Buddy also functions as a scheduling system, todo list and contact list.

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## **Design**

### Architecture

**How the architecture components interact with each other**
![Structure of the Overall Product](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

### Overall components

This is the overall design of our product. As we are using **GUI to help to display the information** and mainly focuses on
using **CLI to take in the required commands**, thus the product consists of **6 main major components**. The product starts
from the Launcher classes, that initiates based on our pre-set settings and then activates the MainApp class
the will run the GUI with these settings. MainApp will also start the _brain_ and -muscles_ of the program, which are the Logic, Storage,
Model and Ui components.

The role of the **Logic** component is to act as the _brain_ of the program, where all the parsing of information will be done, and the
execution of the commands will be carried out.

The role of the **Storage** component is to represent the _memory_ of the program, where the storing and tracking of the different items happens.
These items are saving locally in a json file, which can be imported and exported easily.

The role of the **Model** component is to represent all the items and their behaviours. Contains all the item classes and their support classes.

The role of the **Ui** component is to handle all the User interface related instructions, which includes the loading of GUI components, the updating
of these components and displaying the changes.

## Module Tracker

### UI component
![Structure of the UserInterface Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The job of the UI component is to be the _face_ of the product, which the user directly interacts with.
It is in charge of containing the logic that **breaks down and executes the user input**, and displaying the **GUI** of the
product.

It composes of a few main classes, that serves as the focal point of this component. Such classes are **UiPart**,
**MainWindow**, **UiManager** and the respective panel displays, **(XYZListPanel)**. The rest of the classes are supporting
classes to help make the GUI.

The MainWindow is what the user actually sees, which has a **CommandBox**, **XYZListPanel**, **ResultDisplay** and **StatusBar**. These
components are stacking on top of one another using **stackPane** to ensure a smooth looking GUI. The order of the components
are as follows, **CommandBox**, **ResultDisplay**, **XYZListPanel** and **StatusBar**.

The **CommandBox** is just a textField component where the user can enter the commands. Upon pressing *Enter*, extracting of the
text occurs and is sent to the logic to be parsed and executed.

Next, after the executing is completed, a **CommandResult** object returns and is then passed to the **ResultDisplay** for the
relevant information to be shown in this component. This is being displayed in a TextArea component.

Lastly, the **XYZListPanel** is in charge of displaying all the modules, contacts, etc that is the product is tracking.
Each of these items are being displayed in a *cell* under their respective **XYZCard**, which will be displayed in the *ListCell*
of the **XYZListPanel**.


**API** :

### Logic component

![LogicClassDiagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** : `Logic.java`

1. Logic uses the `ParserManager` class to create the respective Parser classes: `ModuleListParser`, `ContactListParser`
 and `TodoListParser`. Depending on the user command, the user command will be parsed by the relevant Parser class.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the Model (e.g. adding a module).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
help to the user.

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the data for these 3 types of list:
  * module tracker
  * contact list
  * todo list
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<T>` for all types of list as mentioned above which can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component facilitates the storage of CAP5BUDDY data in the hard drive. When the program attempts to save
data, the `Storage` component converts java data objects such as `ModuleList` and `ContactList` into a json format to store
at a specified file location. When the program is started, it will attempt to read existing user data and the `Storage`
component will be converting data in json format into java objects.

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the module list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the contact list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the todo list data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
### Common classes

* Stores a UniqueTodoList
* Duplicate Task objects are now allowed

TodoList will be explained more comprehensively in the [TodoList feature](#todolist-feature) Section

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Add Event feature
![Structure of the Add Event command](images/AddEventSequenceDiagram.png)
#### Proposed Implementation
The idea of this feature is to be able to allow the user to keep track of his/her current events that
will be happening. Events can be either a one time event like an exam for a particular module, or a recurring
event like a weekly tutorial class.

How we are currently implementing this feature is by following the same implementation as the AB3. We have an event
object under the Model package. Two classes called EventName and EventTime act as information containers to store
the respective data and help support the Event class.

We also make sure in the Logic package, there are personal sub-parsers for each of the existing Event
related commands, and an overall Parser known as SchedulerParser that is in charge of managing all of the
sub-parsers of the Scheduler. 

Each of the commands of the Scheduler will always return a CommandResult class, that is basically an information
container that stores all the relevant data of the results. This CommandResult object is then passes back up to the
UiManager, where it is then passed to the GUI components for it to be displayed.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Whether to create a new Parser for Scheduler.
Option 1 **(Current implementation)**: A custom Parser in charge of all **Scheduler** related commands **only**.
Pros: 
- More OOP orientated.
- More defensive programming.
Cons:
- More Parsers to handle by the ParserManager

Option 2: Place the Scheduler related parser together with the rest of the other parsers for other features, like module list, etc.
Pros:
- Faster to implement.
- Less effort needed, simply add on to the existing Parser.
Cons:
- Mess and less readible, hard to distinguish between differnt commands.
- Higher chance of errors, as we are mixing all the different parsers for every feature into a single Parser.
- LONG methods.


### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

### 1.1 Contact List Management

As a module tracking system, Cap 5 Buddy allows users to manage a list of module-related contacts with ease.

The section below provides details of the implementation of each Contact List function and design considerations
of the contact list feature.

#### 1.1.1 Contact List Commands

Below is a list of all `Contact` related features:

1. Add a contact: Adds a new contact into the contact list
2. Delete a contact: Deletes a pre-existing contact from the contact list
3. Edit a contact: Edits a pre-existing contact in the contact list
4. View all contacts: Lists out all contacts in the contact list

Given below is the class diagram of the `Contact` class:

![ContactClassDiagram](images/Contact/ContactClassDiagram.png)

Figure ?.? Class Diagram for Contact class

#### 1.1.2 Details of implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding contact behaves at each step:
1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `addcontact n/John e/john@gmail.com te/@johndoe` from `Ui`
2. `LogicManager` calls `ContactListParser#parseCommand()` to create `AddContactParser`
3. `ContactListParser` will call the respective `AddContactParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments
4. This creates a `AddContactCommand` and `AddContactCommand#execute` will be invoked by `LogicManager`
5. The `Model#addContact()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is used to add the new contact
6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the operation to add a contact works:
![AddContactSequenceDiagram](images/Contact/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)
Figure ?.? Sequence diagram for the execution of `AddContactCommand`

The section below describes the implementation details of each Contact List feature.

####Add Contact Feature
* This feature creates and adds a new `Contact` using the contact details provided by users
* `ContactListParser` invokes `AddContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the command arguments
* `AddContactCommand#execute()` will be called to add the new `Contact` if the contact does not already exist
* The mechanism to add a contact is facilitated by `Contactlist` which implements `ContactList#addContact()`
* This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addContact()`

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddContactCommand`:
![AddContactCommandActivityDiagram](images/Contact/AddContactCommandActivityDiagram.png)
Figure ?.? Activity diagram representing the execution of `AddContactCommand`

#### Delete Contact Feature
* This feature deletes a pre-existing `Contact` using the contact ID provided by users
* `ContactListParser` invokes `DeleteContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the contact ID
* `DeleteContactCommand#execute()` will be called to delete the `Contact`
* The mechanism to delete a contact is facilitated by `ContactList` which implements `ContactList#removeContact()`
* This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteContact()`

#### Edit Contact Feature
* This feature edits a pre-existing `Contact` using the contact details provided by users.
* `ContactListParser` invokes `EditContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the contact ID and command arguments
* `EditContactCommand#execute()` will be called to create the edited `Contact` and replace the old contact with the edited contact,
   if the edited contact does not already exist
* The mechanism to edit a contact is facilitated by `ContactList` which implements `ContactList#setContact()`
* This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setContact()`

#### View Contact Feature


#### 1.1.2 Design Considerations <br>
##### Aspect: Data structure to support Contact related functions
* Alternative 1: Use a `HashMap` to store contacts
  * Pros: Will be more efficient to retrieve contacts from a HashMap.
  * Cons: Requires additional memory to support the HashMap. This would worsen as the number of contacts stored increases.
* Alternative 2: Use an `ArrayList` to store contacts


### \[Proposed\] Calculate CAP feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed calculate CAP function is facilitated by `CalculateCapCommand`. It extends Command with a counter for total
grade points and modular credits, both stored internally `gradePoints` and `modularCredits` respectively. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalculateCapCommand#accumulate(ModuleList)` - Loops through a given `ModuleList` and updates the grade points and
modular credits count accordingly.

* `CalculateCapCommand#calculateCap()` - Calculates CAP based the grade points and modular credits counter.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calculate cap operation works:
![CalculateCapSequenceDiagram](images/CalculateCapSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CalculateCapCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Information used to calculate cap
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Calculates based on academic information on mods tagged as completed.
    * Pros : Easy to implement
    * Cons : User has to manually input every module taken
    
* Alternative 2 : Prompts user for academic information used for last calculated cap and stores it.
    * Pros : 
     * User does not need to input unnecessary modules.
     * Will use less memory.(e.g Modules that the user is not currently taking does not need to be added by user). 
    * Cons : Will require additional storage.

### TodoList feature

#### Implementation

The TodoList feature has two main component :

* **Containee component** (Task-related classes)
  * `Class Task` - container class to store information about a task
  * `Class TaskName` - wrapper class to store the name of a task
  * `Class Date` - wrapper class to store the date/deadline of a task
  * `Enum Priority` - enum class to represent priority of a task
  * `Enum Status` - enum class to represent the progress status of a task

* **Container component** (List-like classes)
  * Class `UniqueTodoList` - container class for storing tasks
  * Class `TodoList` - wrapper class for UniqueTodoList
  * Interface `ReadOnlyTodoList` - interface for displaying the list on the GUI

##### Containee Component

The Task class mainly functions as a class to store all the informations related to a task i.e. name, tag, priority,
date, and status. It does not have any subclasses.

The Task class supports the following operations :

* Setters for all the field
* Getters for all the field
* `Task#isSameTask()` - checks if two tasks are the same i.e. have the same name 
(weaker than Task#equals() which requires all the fields to be the same)
* `Task#hasSameTag()` - checks if the task has the specified tag
* `Task#hasSamePriority()` - checks if the task has the specified priority
* `Task#hasSameDate()` - checks if the task has the specified date

##### Container Component

The TodoList class is facilitated by UniqueTodoList. The UniqueTodoList is stored internally inside
the TodoList class which act like a wrapper class. 

The TodoList class supports the following operations :

* `TodoList#resetData()` - replaces all data in TodoList with new data.
* `TodoList#hasTask()` - checks if the specified task exist in the list.
* `TodoList#addTask()` - adds a task to the list.
* `TodoList#setTask()` - replaces a task with the specified task.
* `TodoList#removeTask()` - removes the specified task from the list.

The operations above are exposed in the Model interface as :

* `Model#hasTask()`
* `Model#addTask()`
* `Model#setTask()`
* `Model#deleteTask()`

TodoList implements ReadOnlyTodoList which require the following operation :

* `ReadOnlyTodoList#getTodoList()` - returns an ObservableList with type Task that is immutable, and we cannot
  modify the elements.

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: Task type

* Alternative 1 (current): <br/>
  Use one concrete class i.e. Task without inheritance involved. The type of the task
  is represented by the Tag field instead.
  
  Pros :
  * Easier to implement
  * Types are not pre-defined i.e. can simply add a different tag to represent different type of task
  
  Cons :
  * All type of task have the same pre-defined field

* Alternative 2 : <br/>
  Use one abstract class i.e. Task with inheritance. Each subclasses represent a type of a Task.
  
  Pros :
  * Difference between type are clear and standardized
  * Can be considered more OOP
  
  Cons :
  * Types must be pre-defined i.e. cannot add new type of classes without adding codes
  
  Alternative 1 is chosen since we prioritize user freedom to create custom type for the task.
  
    
### \[Proposed\] GradeTracker feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed grade tracker feature is an association class used to store additional information for the module. 
The `Assignments` each store their own `assignment name`, `percentage of final grade` and `result`. 

![Structure of the Module List Component](images/GradeTrackerDiagram.png)

When an `assignment` is added, it follows the sequence diagram as shown below. The sequence flows similarly 
to the rest of the project as the command is parsed and then executed.

![Sequence Diagram of the Add Assignment Command](images/AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Format to store the grade for a module
* Alternative 1 : Grade stores CAP.
    * Pros : Easier to integrate with Cap Calculator
    * Cons : User has to manually input CAP and does not know the average from the assignments accumulated
    
* Alternative 2 (current choice): Grade stores the raw score calculated from assignment
    * Pros : Grade can be automatically calculated from the assignment overall percentage for user to view
    * Cons : Requires separate CAP to be stored for Cap Calculator to access
