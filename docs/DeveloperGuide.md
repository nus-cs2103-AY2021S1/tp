## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Reeve**!

**Reeve** is a desktop application for **private tutors to better manage both administrative and academic details of their students**, optimised for use via a
**Command Line Interface (CLI)** for receiving inputs while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for displaying information.
In addition, **Reeve** comes with a customisable personal scheduler to assist users to keep track of their classes. **Reeve** also allows users to set timely reminders for themselves.

**Reeve** is optimized for users that are very comfortable with typing as it works on a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Students' details are displayed in a neat and organized manner through the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## 2. About

This developer guide will provide you the details of the software architecture and implementation of **Reeve**.
It is made for developers who wish to understand the internal and external workings of the application.

All developers are warmly welcome to contribute your ideas and improve **Reeve**!
To contribute, simply head over to [our github](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp) and raise an issue.

## 3. Understanding the Guide

This section will share with you how should you go about understanding this guide in order to best understand **Reeve**.

We have adopted the "top-down" approach into the structure of this guide where we will first look at the high-level structure of our application
before going into the implementation details of each feature.

We highly encourage you to read the guide from top to bottom in order to have the best understanding of **Reeve**.

Here is a summary (Table 1) of the symbols that are used in this Developer Guide:

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## 5. **Design**
 
### 5.1 Architecture

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" align="center" width="450"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 1: Architecture Diagram</div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#56-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#52-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#53-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#54-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#55-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (in the diagram below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

<p align="center"><img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 2: Logic Component Class Diagram</div><br>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" align="center" width="574"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 3: Architecture Sequence Diagram</div><br>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 5.2 UI component

<p align="center"><img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 4: Ui Component Class Diagram</div><br>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `Notebook` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 5.3 Logic component

<p align="center"><img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 5: Logic Component Class Diagram</div><br>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ReeveParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<p align="center"><img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 6: Delete Sequence Diagram</div><br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 5.4 Model component

<p align="center"><img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 7: Model Component Class Diagram</div><br>

<p align="center"><img src="images/AdminClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 8: Admin Class Diagram</div><br>

<p align="center"><img src="images/AcademicClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 9: Academic Class Diagram</div><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* holds the data of **Reeve** in memory.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### 5.5 Storage component

<p align="center"><img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 10: Storage Class Diagram</div><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

From the diagram above, the `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Reeve` data in json format and read it back.
* stores `Student` and `Note` data from the `Model` component in `JsonSerializableReeve` and `JsonSerializableNotebook` objects respectively.

The `JsonSerializableReeve` component stores `JsonAdaptedStudent` objects converted from the `Student` objects in the `Model` component.
Each `JsonAdaptedStudent` object also contains json-friendly versions of `Student` data as shown in the class diagram below.

<p align="center"><img src="images/JsonSerializableReeveClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 11: JsonSerializableReeve Class Diagram</div><br>

The `JsonSerializableNotebook` component stores `JsonAdaptedNote` objects converted from `Note` objects in the `Model` component, as shown in the class diagram below.

<p align="center"><img src="images/JsonSerializableNotebookClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 12: JsonSerializableNotebook Class Diagram</div><br>

### 5.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## 6. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 6.1 General features

This section describes some key details on how general features are implemented.

#### 6.1.1 Help Command

The following describes the flow of how `HelpCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `HelpCommand#execute(Model model)` is called.
2. A `CommandResult` with the `shouldShowHelp` field set to true is returned and `MainWindow#handleHelp()` is called.
3. A Help display window will be opened showing a link to the User Guide.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: If there is already a Help window already opened, and `HelpCommand` is executed, `HelpWindow#focus()` will be called to focus on the already opened window.

</div>

#### 6.1.2 Toggle Command

The following describes the flow of how `ToggleStudentCardCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `ToggleStudentCardCommand#execute(Model model)` is called.
2. A `CommandResult` with the `toggleStudentCard` field set to true is returned and `MainWindow#handleAcademicPanel()` is called.
3. Student cards in `StudentListPanel` will be switched.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: By default, `StudentListPanel` uses the `StudentAcademicCard`.

</div><br>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ToggleStudentCardCommand` execution works.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ToggleStudentCardSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 13: ToggleStudentCard Sequence Diagram</div><br>

The following explains the design considerations of the `toggle` command.

**Aspect: How the GUI responds when toggle is executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Switch between two types of student cards, student academic card and student admin card for the cards used in the student list panel.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, reduces cluttering of information, allows for better focus on different information,.
    * Cons: Can take a long time to execute finish or introduce unfinished toggling if student list is large.
    
* **Alternative 2**: Introduce two tabs, one for admin details and the other for academic details and toggling switches between these two tabs.
    * Pros: Student list size does not slow down execution of command.
    * Cons: Double the work when executing commands such as `find` because there are now two lists to update, repeat of basic information such as student's name, phone, school and academic level, harder to implement.
    
#### 6.1.3 Exit Command

The following describes the flow of how `ExitCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `ExitCommand#execute(Model model)` is called.
2. A `CommandResult` with the `shouldExit` field set to true is returned and `MainWindow#handleExit()` is called.
3. **Reeve** shuts down.

### 6.2 Student administrative details features

This section describes some key details on how administrative details features are implemented.

#### 6.2.1 Add Student Command

The following describes the flow of how `AddCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `AddCommand#execute(Model model)` is called which checks whether
the added student already exists in the `UniqueStudentList` using the `Model#hasStudent(Student toAdd)`.
2. A unique student is defined by `Name`, `Phone`, `School` and `Year`. If a duplicate student is defined,
a `CommandException` is thrown and the student will not be added.
3. The `AddCommand#execute(Model model)` also checks if the student to be added has clashing `ClassTime` with other students already in the `UniqueStudentList`.
4. Two student's `ClassTime` are considered clashing if they overlap either partially or fully. A `CommandException` will be thrown if there are other students with clashing class time.
5. If the added student is not a duplicate and there are no clashes in class time, then the `Model#addStudent(Student toAdd)` is called to add the student.
A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message and the added student.
6. The student is be added into `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the execution of the `AddCommand`:

<div align="center">Figure 15: Add Student Activity Diagram</div><br>

#### 6.2.2 Edit Student Command

The following describes the flow of how `EditCommand` is executed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` is called which checks if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position, a `CommandException` is thrown and the student is not edited.
3. If there is such a student, the `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` then creates the edited student, and checks to see if the edited student already exists in the `UniqueStudentList` using the `Model#hasStudent(Student toAdd)`.
4. If it is a duplicate student, a `CommandException` is thrown and the edited student will not be added.
5. The `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` also checks if the edited student has clashing `ClassTime` with other students already in the `UniqueStudentList`.
6. Two student's `ClassTime` are considered clashing if they overlap either partially or fully. A `CommandException` will be thrown if there are other students with clashing class time.
7. If the edited student is not a duplicate and there are no clashes in class time, then the`Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the outdated student with the edited copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the newly edited student.
8. The edited student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `EditCommand` execution works.

<p align="center"><img src="images/EditStudentSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>

<div align="center">Figure 17: Edit Student Activity Diagram</div><br>

#### 6.2.3 Delete Student Command

The following describes the flow of how `DeleteCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, the `DeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` is called which checks whether
the specified `Index` is a valid index based on the `UniqueStudentList`, in the case where it is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown and no student will be deleted.
2. Otherwise, the `Student` at the specified valid `Index` is then removed from the `UniqueStudentList` using the `Model#deleteStudent(Student target)` method.
3. The specified student is deleted from the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: A valid `Index` is one that is within the bounds of the `UniqueStudentList`.

</div>

#### 6.2.4 Find Student Command

The following describes the flow of how `FindCommand` is performed.

1. After the `FindCommand`  is created by parsing user input, `FindCommand::execute` is called.
2. The method then calls `getPredicates()` of the `FindStudentDescriptor` stored within `FindCommand` to obtain a `List<Predicate>` to search with.
3. The predicates within `List<Predicate>`are then combined into `consolidatedPredicate`.
4. The `FilteredList<Student>` within the `Model` is then updated using `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate predicate)` for display.
5. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `FindCommand` execution works.

<p align="center"><img src="images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 18: Find Student Sequence Diagram</div><br>

<p align="center"><img src="images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 19: Find Student Activity Diagram</div><br>

#### 6.2.5 Overdue Command

The overdue payment filter feature allows the tutor to find all students who have not paid their tuition fees in the past month. It is handled by the `OverdueCommand`.

The following describes the flow of how `OverdueCommand` is executed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `OverdueCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to filter all students in **Reeve** whose last date of payment was more than a month ago.
2. `Model#updateFilteredStudentsList(Predicate<Student> predicate)` is called to find only students that match the above condition. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a successful message indicating the number of matching students.
3. The filtered student list replaces the displayed list on the GUI and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `OverdueCommand` execution works.

<p align="center"><img src="images/OverdueSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>

<div align="center">Figure 21: Overdue Activity Diagram</div><br>

#### 6.2.6 Detail Commands

The Detail commands keep track of any additional details a tutor wants to add to a student. They comprise of the following commands:

* `AddDetailCommand` - Adds a detail to a specified student.
* `EditDetailCommand` - Edits a specified detail in a specified student.
* `DeleteDetailCommand` - Deletes a specified detail from a specified student.

##### 6.2.6.1 Add Detail Command

The following describes the flow of how `AddDetailCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `AddDetailCommand#execute(Model model)`, and it checks if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the detail will not be added.
3. If the student exists, the detail is added to the student's list of details, and `DetailCommand#updateStudentDetail(Student studentToAddDetail, List<Detail> details)` is called to create a modified copy of the student with the new detail.
4. `Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the detail added.
5. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the detail adding operation works.

#### 6.2.7 Sort Command

This is an explanation of how `SortCommand` works.

1. After the `SortCommand` is successfully parsed, `SortCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to execute the command.
2. The `comparisonMeans` stored within the `SortCommand` is checked against `NameComparator.COMPARISON_MEANS`, `ClassTimeComparator.COMPARISON_MEANS` and `YearComparator.COMPARISON_MEANS`.
3. If `comparisonMeans` matches the comparison means of `NameComparator`, `NameComparator.COMPARISON_MEANS`, a new `NameComparator` is created and `Model#updateSortedStudentList(Comparator<? extends Student> comparator)` called.
4. Step 3 is repeated similarly for `ClassTimeComparator` and `YearComparator`.
5. If `comparisonMeans` matches no comparison means in steps 3 and 4, a `CommandException` is thrown.
6. The student list is sorted and a `CommandResult` with the success message is returned. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `SortCommand` execution works.

### 6.3 Student academic details features

This section describes some key details on how academic details features are implemented.

#### 6.3.1 Question Commands

The Question commmands keep track of questions raised by a student to his tutor. They comprise of the following commands:

* `AddQuestionCommand` - Adds a question to a specified student.
* `SolveQuestionCommand` - Marks a specified question from a specified student as solved.
* `DeleteQuestionCommand` - Deletes a specified question from a specified student.

##### 6.3.1.1 Add Question Command

The following describes the flow of how `AddQuestionCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `AddQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `AddQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if the student already has a similar question recorded.
4. A unique question is defined solely by its `question` and does not take into account if the question has been solved. If a duplicate question is found, a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
5. If the question is not a duplicate, `Student#addQuestion(Question question)` is called to create a modified copy of the student with a newly added question.
6. `Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the question added.
7. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the question adding operation works.

<div align="center">Figure 31: Add Question Activity Diagram</div><br>

##### 6.3.1.2 Solve Question Command

The following describes the flow of how `SolveQuestionCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `SolveQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `SolveQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if there is a question at the specified position.
4. If the question does not exist, a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be resolved.
5. If the question exists, `Student#setQuestion(Question target, Question newQuestion)` is called to create a modified copy of the student where the specified question has been replaced with a solved version.
6. `Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the question solved.
7. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

<div align="center">Figure 33: Solve Question Activity Diagram</div><br>

##### 6.3.1.3 Delete Question Command

The following describes the flow of how `DeleteQuestionCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `DeleteQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `DeleteQuestionCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if there is a question at the specified position.
4. If the question does not exist, a `CommandException` is thrown and the question will not be resolved.
5. If the question exists, `Student#deleteQuestion(Question target)` is called to create a modified copy of the student without the specified question.
6. `Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the question removed.
7. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the question deletion operation works.

<p align="center"><img src="images/DeleteQuestionSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 34: Delete Question Sequence Diagram</div><br>

<div align="center">Figure 35: Delete Question Activity Diagram</div><br>

##### 6.3.1.4 Design considerations

The `Student` class guarantees immutability, including its list of `Question` objects. As such, any operation must return a modified copy instead of directly modifying the base list.

The pros of doing so is that it becomes easier to test and debug as there are fewer mutations to worry about.

The downside, however, that this approach is more memory-intensive and possibly slower, since changing a single question involves recreating the entire list of questions attached to the student.

Having considered that our target audience (one-to-one private tutors) are unlikely to have so much data that this would severely impact performance, we believe that this is worth the trade-off.

#### 6.3.2 Exam Commands

The Exam commands keep track of exam records of a student. They comprise of the following commands:

* `AddExamCommand` - Adds a exam record to a specified student.
* `DeleteExamCommand` - Deletes a specified exam record from a specified student.
* `ExamStatsCommand` - Displays the exam statistics of a specified student in the form of a line graph.

The structure of exam commands is as shown below:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ExamCommandClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 36: Exam Command Class Diagram</div><br>

##### 6.3.2.1 Add exam command

The following describes the flow of how `AddExamCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `AddExamCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the exam will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `AddExamCommand#execute(Model model)` checks if the student already has a similar exam recorded.
4. A unique exam is defined solely by its `examName`. If a duplicate exam is found, a `CommandException` is thrown and the exam will not be added.
5. If the exam is not a duplicate, `Student#getExams()` is called get the current list of exams of the specified student.
6. The new exam is added into this current list and a new updated `Student` is created which has exactly the same characteristics as the specified student but with the updated exam list.
7. `Model#setStudent(Student selectedStudent, Student updatedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the updated copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the exam added.
8. The updated student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

The sequence and activity diagrams are very similar to those of the [detail adding command](#6261-add-detail-command)

:information_source: Exams are specified based on the indexes of the list of exams shown on the academic view of student details.

</div><br>

The sequence and activity diagrams are very similar to those of the [detail deleting command](#6263-delete-detail-command)

##### 6.3.2.3 Exam Stats command

The following describes the flow of how `ExamStatsCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `ExamStatsCommand#execute(Model model)` is called to check if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and no exam statistics window will be shown.
3. If the student exists, `ExamStatsCommand#execute(Model model)` gets the specified student from `sortedStudentList`.
4. A `CommandResult` with a non-null student input is returned and `MainWindow#handleExamStats(Student student)` is called.
5. A new ExamStats display window will be opened showing a line graph representing the exam scores of the specified student.

The following sequence diagram shows how the exam stats operation works.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ExamStatsSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 37: Exam Stats Sequence Diagram</div><br>

The following activity diagram summarises the flow of events when `ExamStatsCommand` is executed.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ExamStatsActivityDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 38: Exam Stats Activity Diagram</div><br>

The following explains the design considerations of the `exam stats` command.

**Aspect: How the GUI responds when exam stats is executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Open new window that displays exam statistics.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, allows for comparison and reference with student data, allows for multiple students' exam statistics to be opened, easy for users to understand.
    * Cons: Can be more taxing on processor if many windows are opened simultaneously 
    
* **Alternative 2**: Switch from the displayed student list panel to an exam statistics panel.
    * Pros: Only one window open at all time.
    * Cons: Unable to compare and reference with student data, harder to implement, can introduce confusion when trying to switch back to the student list panel.

#### 6.3.3 Attendance Commands

The Attendance commands keep track of the attendance for a student. They comprise of the following commands:

* `AddAttendanceCommand` - Adds an attendance to a specified student.
* `DeleteAttendanceCommand` - Deletes a specified attendance from a specified student.

##### 6.3.3.1 Add Attendance Command

The following describes the flow of how `AddAttendanceCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successfully parsing the user input, `AddAttendanceCommand#execute(Model model)`, and it checks if the student at the specified position exists.
2. If there is no student at the specified position,  a `CommandException` is thrown and the attendance will not be added.
3. If the student exists, `AddAttendanceCommand#execute(Model model)` then checks if the student has an existing attendance with the input attendance date.
4. If there is such an attendance, a `CommandException` is thrown and the attendance will not be added.
5. If there is no such attendance, the attendance is added to the student's list of attendances, and `AttendanceCommand#updateStudentAttendance(Student studentToAddAttendance, List<Attendance> attendances)` is called to create a modified copy of the student with the new attendance.
4. `Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` is called to replace the student with the modified copy. A new `CommandResult` is returned with a success message showing the affected student and the attendance added.
5. The modified student replaces the outdated student in the `UniqueStudentList` and a success message is shown in the result display.

### 6.4 Schedule Command

This section describes the operations that `ScheduleViewCommand` performs.

1. Upon successful parsing of the user input, the `ScheduleViewCommand#execute(Model)` method is called.
2. The method `Model#setViewDate(LocalDate)` is then called to set the viewing date of the user in `SchedulePrefs`
3. Similarly, the method `ModelsetViewMode(ScheduleViewMode)` is called next to set the viewing mode (weekly/daily) of the user in `SchedulePrefs`.
4. After which, the method `updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate)` is called to get all the students.
The `Predicate` argument will be `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS` which is a reusable final predicate variable.
5. Thereafter, the method `Model#updateClassTimesToEvent()` will be called to translate all student's `ClassTime` to `LessonEvent`
6. The `Scheduler` then calls the method `resetData(List<Event>)` with the updated `LessonEvent` objects.
7. The `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram illustrates to execution of the `ScheduleViewCommand`:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 43: Schedule Sequence Diagram</div><br>

The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of events when the `ScheduleViewCommand` is being executed:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ScheduleActivityDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 44: Schedule Activity Diagram</div><br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Figure 43 and 44 illustrates the `ScheduleCommand` execution within the `Logic` and `Model` Component.

</div>

For the `Ui` component, a calendar using  [jfxtras-icalendarfx](https://jfxtras.org/doc/8.0/jfxtras-icalendarfx/index.html) will be updated with the `LessonEvent` after the `CommandResult` is returned.
The `'LessonEvent` is provided to the `Ui` by the `LogicManager` through the `Model` component.
The `Model` in turns gets the `LessonEvent` from the `Scheduler` which keeps a list of updated events.
The calendar with `LessonEvent` is then displayed to the user through the interface. This is assuming that no exception arises.

The following are the various design choices made regarding the feature and alternatives that were considered prior to implementation.

* Current Implementation:
    * The current implementation creates `LessonEvent` from the `studentList` and update to the `Ui` whenever the `ScheduleViewCommand` is called.

* Alternatives Considered:
    * Creating a `Event` storage component that stores `LessonEvent` based on `Student`'s `ClassTime`.
    This would violate the data integrity of the `Student` we currently have and introduce additional complexity in
    maintaining both data structures.

### 6.5 Notebook feature

This section describes the implementation of the notebook feature and the various commands relating to notebook.

The notebook feature comprises three specific commands extending `NoteCommand`:

* `AddNoteCommand` – Adds a note to the notebook.
* `EditNoteCommand` – Edits a note in the notebook.
* `DeleteNoteCommand` – Deletes a note from the notebook

The following class diagram shows how the various commands relate to each other. (refer to [5.3 Logic Component](#53-logic-component) for higher-level details about the design)

<p align="center"><img src="images/NoteCommandClassDiagram.png" align="center"/></p>
<div align="center">Figure 45: Note Command Class Diagram</div><br>

#### 6.5.1 Add note command

This section describes how `AddNoteCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successful parsing of the user input, `AddNoteCommand#execute(Model model)` is called which checks whether there is already a note with the same title in `NotesList` using `Model#hasNote(Note toAdd)`.
2. If a duplicate note is found, a `CommandException` is thrown, and the note will not be added.
3. Otherwise, `Model#addNote(Note toAdd)` will be called, and the note will be added.
4. A `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

#### 6.5.2 Edit note command

This section describes how `EditNoteCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successful parsing of the user input, `EditNoteCommand#execute(Model model)` is called.
2. During the execution, `Model#getNotebook()` is called to retrieve the notebook in **Reeve** and `ReadOnlyNotebook#getNotesList()` is called from the notebook to retrieve the list of notes.
3. The `Index` is checked to ensure that it is valid; if it is not, a `CommandException` is thrown, and no note will be edited.
4. The note at `index` is retrieved, and a new note, `editedNote` is created based on this note and the `EditNoteDescriptor` stored within the `EditNoteCommand`.
5. `editedNote` is checked to ensure that it is not the same as the original note retrieved. A `CommandException` is thrown if it is the same note.
6. `Model#setNote(Note notetoEdit, Note editedNote)` is called to edit `noteToEdit` to `editedNote` in `model`.
7. A `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

#### 6.5.3 Delete note command

This section describes how `DeleteNoteCommand` is performed.

1. Upon successful parsing of the user input, `DeleteNoteCommand#execute(Model model)` is called.
2. During the execution, `Model#getNotebook()` is called to retrieve the `ReadOnlyNotebook` in **Reeve** and `ReadOnlyNotebook#getNotesList()` is called to retrieve the `List<Note>`.
3. The `Index` is checked to ensure that it is valid; if it is not, a `CommandException` is thrown, and no note will be deleted.
4. The `Note` at `Index` is removed from the notebook using `Model#deleteNote(Note noteToDelete)`.
5. A `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.
