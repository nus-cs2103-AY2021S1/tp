## **Section 4 - Design**

### Section 4.1 - High-Level Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />
<figcaption> Figure 4.1a Architecture Diagram of Trackr </figcaption>

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of Trackr. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

-   at app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
-   at shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes clean-up methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#section-46---common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

-   [**`UI`**](#section-42---ui-component): The UI of the App.
-   [**`Logic`**](#section-43---logic-component): The command executor.
-   [**`Model`**](#section-44---model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
-   [**`Storage`**](#section-45---storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

-   defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
-   exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 4.1b Class Diagram of the Logic Component </figcaption>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### Section 4.2 - UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 4.2a Class Diagram of the UI Component </figcaption>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` Component defines what the user will see and interact with while using Trackr. 

`MainWindow` is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ViewDisplay` etc. 
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. 
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
-   executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
-   listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

### Section 4.3 - Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 4.3a Class Diagram of the Logic Component </figcaption>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component contains the `TrackrParser` object that creates `Parser` objects for each `Command` based on the user input taken from the `UI` component. The `Parser` object will break down the user input to obtain the arguments, and either create the corresponding `Command` object or throw an exception in the case of invalid inputs for the arguments. The `Logic` component also contains the `Model` component which allows for execution of the created `Command`.

1. `Logic` uses the `TrackrParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student to a tutorial group).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteTG 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTG 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 4.3b Sequence Diagram of DeleteTutorialGroupCommand </figcaption>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTutorialGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
### Section 4.4 - Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 4.4a Class Diagram of the Model Component </figcaption>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component contains the `Trackr` object, that handles the main type of data in the app, which is in the form of a list of `Module` objects. The `Module` object contains a list of `TutorialGroup` objects, and the `TutorialGroup` objects contains a list of `Student` objects. The `ModelManager` class exposes the methods which allows for the manipulation of this data (e.g. Editing a `Module` object's `ModuleId` object, deleting a `TutorialGroup` object, adding participation score for a `Student` object).

The `Model` component,

-   stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
-   stores the Trackr data.
-   exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>`, `ObservableList<TutorialGroup>` and `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
-   does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Section 4.5 - Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 4.5a Class Diagram of the Storage Component </figcaption>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component contains the `JsonModuleListStorage` object, which contains the `JsonSerializableModuleListStorage` which serves as the JSON version of a Trackr object; the main data type in the app. The methods `readModuleList()` and `saveModuleList()` convert the JSON objects to and from their native object types respectively (e.g. Converting a `JsonAdaptedTutorialGroup` object into a `TutorialGroup` object).

The `Storage` component,

-   can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
-   can save the `Trackr` data in json format and read it back.

### Section 4.6 - Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package, the package contains 2 sub packages, which are:

- core: Contains software settings and information, also contains loggers for debugging purposes.
- util: Contains utilities for other classes to use. Utilities can perform tasks such as parse strings or convert objects to and from JSON format.

## **Section 5 - Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

Trackr has three different data types: 
- `Module`: The current module the user is teaching
- `TutorialGroup`: The tutorial groups that the user is teaching
- `Student`: The students currently being taught by the user

As shown in Figure 4.4a, 
Trackr stores these data in the following manner: UniqueModuleList contains Modules. Each Module has a UniqueTutorialGroupList 
that stores all the Tutorial Groups of that particular Module. Lastly, each Tutorial Group has a UniqueStudentList that stores all the
Students of that particular Tutorial Group.

Trackr's three data types also share the some commands, which are:
* Add
* Delete
* Edit
* Find
* List
* View
* Clear
* Exit

Since Trackr stores and manages its data recursively, these shared commands for Module, Tutorial Group and Student work in a similar manner.

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: List to contain the data types**
- Alternative 1: Use a single generic `UniqueList` that contains the data types.
    - Pros: Code that is easier to maintain due to abstraction. 
    - Cons: Harder to implement.
- Alternative 2 (Current choice): Use a separate `UniqueList` for each model such as `UniqueModuleList`.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: More repetitive code.

### Section 5.1 - Add Commands - `addMod`, `addTG` and `addStudent`

#### Overview

The Add command in Trackr enables users to easily add data types to the app. Users will be able to keep track of data they are
in charge of.

#### Implementation
Each Add command for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student` is split into `AddModuleCommand`, `AddTutorialGroupCommand`, and `AddStudentCommand`, respectively.
Each command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `AddModuleCommand` of Trackr.

![AddModuleSequenceDiagram](images/AddModSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.1a Sequence Diagram of AddModuleCommand</figcaption>

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.1b Activity Diagram of AddModuleCommand</figcaption>

Step 1. The user executes `addMod m/CS2103T` to add a module called CS2103T to Trackr. The `addMod` command calls
`LogicManager#execute(String)`.

Step 2. The contents of the `String` is parsed in `AddModuleCommandParser#parse(String)`. This method creates a new
`Module` object with the parsed arguments. An `AddModuleCommand` object is then initialised with this `Module` object.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute(String)` calls the `AddModuleCommand#execute(Model)` method of the `AddModuleCommand`
object.

Step 4. Within `Model`, the method `Model#addModule(Module)` is executed and this adds the `Module` to the
`internalList` of `UniqueModuleList`.

Step 5. Once the `Module` has been added to the `internaList`, `AddModuleCommand#execute(Model)` creates a
`CommandResult` object and the `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.

> Note: There are some differences for the add commands of `TutorialGroup` and `Student` during Step 4.
>
> For `TutorialGroup`:
> - Within each `Module`, there is an `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Tutorial Group View using `Model#isInTutorialGroupView()`.
> This ensures that there is a target `Module` for the `TutorialGroup` to be added to.
> - `Model#addTutorialGroup(TutorialGroup)` method then retrieves the `UniqueTutorialGroupList` of the target `Module`
> and adds the `TutorialGroup` to the `internalList` of the `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
>
> For `Student`:
> - Within each `TutorialGroup`, there is an `UniqueStudentList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Student View using `Model#isInStudentView()`. This ensures
> that there is a target `Module` and `TutorialGroup` for the `Student` to be added to.
> - `Model#addStudent(Student)` method then retrieves the `UniqueStudentList` of the target `Module` and `TutorialGroup`
> and adds the `Student` to the `internalList` of the `UniqueStudentList`.

### Section 5.2 - Delete Commands - `deleteMod`, `deleteTG` and `deleteStudent`

#### Overview

The Delete command in Trackr enables users to easily delete data types from the app.

#### Implementation
Each Delete command for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student` is split into `DeleteModuleCommand`, `DeleteTutorialGroupCommand`, and `DeleteStudentCommand`, respectively.
Each command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `DeleteModuleCommand` of Trackr.

![DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.2a Sequence Diagram of DeleteModuleCommand</figcaption>

![DeleteCommandActivityDiagram](images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.2b Activity Diagram of DeleteModuleCommand</figcaption>

Step 1. The user executes `deleteMod 1` to delete the first module in the displayed list. The `deleteMod` command calls
`LogicManager#execute(String)`.

Step 2. The contents of the `String` is parsed in `DeleteModuleCommandParser#parse(String)`. This method creates a new
`Index` object with the parsed arguments. A `DeleteModuleCommand` object is then initialised with this `Index` object.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute(String)` calls the `DeleteModuleCommand#execute(Model)` method of the
`DeleteModuleCommand` object.

Step 4. Within `Model`, the method `Model#deleteModule(Module)` is executed and this deletes the `Module` from the
`internalList` of `UniqueModuleList`.

Step 5. Once the `Module` has been deleted from the `internaList`, `DeleteModuleCommand#execute(Model)` creates an
`CommandResult` object and the `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.

> Note: There are some differences for the delete commands of `TutorialGroup` and `Student` during Step 4.
>
> For `TutorialGroup`:
> - Within each `Module`, there is an `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Tutorial Group View using `Model#isInTutorialGroupView()`.
> This ensures that there is a target `Module` for the `TutorialGroup` to be deleted from.
> - `Model#deleteTutorialGroup(TutorialGroup)` method then retrieves the `UniqueTutorialGroupList` of the target
> `Module` and deletes the `TutorialGroup` from the `internalList` of the `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
>
> For `Student`:
> - Within each `TutorialGroup`, there is a `UniqueStudentList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Student View using `Model#isInStudentView()`. This ensures
> that there is a target `Module` and `TutorialGroup` for the `Student` to be deleted from.
> - `Model#deleteStudent(Student)` method then retrieves the `UniqueStudentList` of the target `Module` and
> `TutorialGroup` and deletes the `Student` from the `internalList` of the `UniqueStudentList`.

### Section 5.3 - Edit Commands - `editMod`, `editTG` and `editStudent`

#### Overview

The Edit command in Trackr enables users to easily edit data types. Users will be able to modify data.

#### Implementation
Each Edit command for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student` is split into `EditModuleCommand`, `EditTutorialGroupCommand`, and `EditStudentCommand`, respectively.
Each command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `EditModuleCommand` of Trackr.

![EditModuleSequenceDiagram](images/EditModuleSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.3a Sequence Diagram of EditModuleCommand</figcaption>

![EditCommandActivityDiagram](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.3b Activity Diagram of EditModuleCommand</figcaption>

Step 1. The user executes `editMod 1 m/CS2100` to edit the first module in the displayed list. The `editMod` command 
calls `LogicManager#execute(String)`.

Step 2. The contents of the `String` is parsed in `EditModuleCommandParser#parse(String)`. This method creates a new
`Index` and `EditModuleDescriptor` object with the parsed arguments. An `EditModuleCommand` object is then initialised
with the `Index` and `EditModuleDescriptor` object.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute(String)` calls the `EditModuleCommand#execute(Model)` method of the `EditModuleCommand`
object. The method creates a new `Module` object with the edited fields.

Step 4. Within `Model`, the method `Model#setModule(Module, Module)` is executed and this replaces the current `Module`
from the `internalList` of `UniqueModuleList` with the edited one.

Step 5. Once the `Module` has been edited in the `internaList`, `EditModuleCommand#execute(Model)` creates an
`CommandResult` object and the `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.

> Note: There are some differences for the edit commands of `TutorialGroup` and `Student` during Step 4.
>
> For `TutorialGroup`:
> - Within each `Module`, there is an `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Tutorial Group View using `Model#isInTutorialGroupView()`.
> This ensures that there is a target `Module` for the `TutorialGroup` to be edited from.
> - `Model#setTutorialGroup(TutorialGroup, TutorialGroup)` method then retrieves the `UniqueTutorialGroupList` of the
> target `Module` and edits the `TutorialGroup` in the `internalList` of the `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
>
> For `Student`:
> - Within each `TutorialGroup`, there is a `UniqueStudentList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Student View using `Model#isInStudentView()`. This ensures
> that there is a target `Module` and `TutorialGroup` for the `Student` to be edited from.
> - `Model#setStudent(Student, Student)` method then retrieves the `UniqueStudentList` of the target `Module` and
> `TutorialGroup` and edits the `Student` in the `internalList` of the `UniqueStudentList`.

### Section 5.4 - Find Commands - `findMod`, `findTG` and `findStudent`

#### Overview

The Find command in Trackr enables users to easily find data based on keywords. This will save their time whenever they want to 
find a specific data.

#### Implementation
Each Find command for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student` is split into `FindModuleCommand`, `FindTutorialGroupCommand`, and `FindStudentCommand`, respectively.
Each command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `FindModuleCommand` of Trackr.

![FindModuleSequenceDiagram](images/FindModuleSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.4a Sequence Diagram of FindModuleCommand</figcaption>

![FindCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.4b Activity Diagram of FindModuleCommand</figcaption>

Step 1. The user executes `findMod cs2100` to find module(s) that contain the keyword _cs2100_. The `findMod` command 
calls `LogicManager#execute(String)`.

Step 2. The contents of the `String` is parsed in `FindModuleCommandParser#parse(String)`. This method creates a new
`ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the parsed arguments. A `FindModuleCommand` object is then initialised
with the `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute(String)` calls the `FindModuleCommand#execute(Model)` method of the `FindModuleCommand`
object.

Step 4. Within `Model`, the method `Model#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate<Module>)` is executed and this updates
the displayed list of modules.

Step 5. `FindModuleCommand#execute(Model)` creates a `CommandResult` object and the `CommandResult` is returned to
`LogicManager`.

> Note: There are some differences for the find commands of `TutorialGroup` and `Student` during Step 4. `TutorialGroup`
> also has its own predicate class called `TutorialContainsKeywordsPredicate` while `Student`'s predicate class is
> called `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
>
> For `TutorialGroup`:
> - Within each `Module`, there is an `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Tutorial Group View using `Model#isInTutorialGroupView()`.
> This ensures that there is a target `Module` for the `TutorialGroup` to be searched from.
> - `Model#updateFilteredTutorialGroupList(Predicate<TutorialGroup>)` method then updates the displayed list of
> tutorial groups.
>
> For `Student`:
> - Within each `TutorialGroup`, there is a `UniqueStudentList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Student View using `Model#isInStudentView()`. This ensures
> that there is a target `Module` and `TutorialGroup` for the `Student` to be searched from.
> - `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student>)` method then updates the displayed list of students.
>
> The commands `attendanceBelow` and `participationBelow` also follow similar implementations. Their predicate classes
> are `AttendanceBelowSpecifiedScorePredicate` and `ParticipationBelowSpecifiedScorePredicate` respectively. Like the
> aforementioned find command for `Student`, `attendanceBelow` and `participationBelow` uses the 
> `Model#updateFilteredStudentList` method to update the displaye list of students.

### Section 5.5 - List Commands - `listMod`, `listTG` and `listStudent`

#### Overview

The List command in Trackr enables users to easily list all data. Users will be able to see all data after using the Find Commands.

#### Implementation
Each List command for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student` is split into `ListModuleCommand`, `ListTutorialGroupCommand`, and `ListStudentCommand`, respectively.
Each command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `ListModuleCommand` of Trackr.

![ListModSequenceDiagram](images/ListModuleCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.5a Sequence Diagram of ListModuleCommand</figcaption>

![ListCommandActivityDiagram](images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.5b Activity Diagram of ListModuleCommand</figcaption>

Step 1. The user executes `listMod` to view all the modules in Trackr. The `listMod` command calls
`LogicManager#execute(String)`.

Step 2. The contents of the `String` is parsed in `TrackrParser#parseCommand(String)`. This method creates a new
`ListModuleCommand` object.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute(String)` calls the `ListModuleCommand#execute(Model)` method of the `ListModuleCommand`
object.

Step 4. Within `Model`, the method `Model#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate<Module>)` is executed and this displays
all the modules within Trackr.

Step 5. `ListModuleCommand#execute(Model)` creates a `CommandResult` object and the `CommandResult` is returned to
`LogicManager`.

> Note: There are some differences for the list commands of `TutorialGroup` and `Student` during Step 4.
>
> For `TutorialGroup`:
> - Within each `Module`, there is an `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Tutorial Group View using `Model#isInTutorialGroupView()`.
> This ensures that there is a target `Module` for the `TutorialGroup` to be listed from.
> - `Model#updateFilteredTutorialGroupList(Predicate<TutorialGroup>)` method then displays all the tutorial groups
> within the target `Module`.
>
> For `Student`:
> - Within each `TutorialGroup`, there is an `UniqueStudentList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Student View using `Model#isInStudentView()`. This ensures
> that there is a target `Module` and `TutorialGroup` for the `Student` to be listed from.
> - `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student>)` method then displays all the students within the target 
> `Module` and `TutorialGroup`.

### Section 5.6 - View Commands - `viewTG` and `viewStudent`

#### Overview

The View command in Trackr enables users to easily navigate between the different views: Module View, Tutorial Group View and Student View.

#### Implementation
Each View command for `TutorialGroup`, and `Student` is split into `ViewTutorialGroupCommand`, and `ViewStudentCommand`, respectively. Note that there
is no View command for `Module`. Each command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `ViewTutorialGroupCommand` of Trackr.

![ViewTGSequenceDiagram](images/ViewTutorialGroupCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.6a Sequence Diagram of ViewTutorialGroupCommand</figcaption>

![ViewTGActivityDiagram](images/ViewTutorialGroupCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.6b Activity Diagram of ViewTutorialGroupCommand</figcaption>

Step 1. The user executes `viewTG 1` to view the tutorial groups of the first module within the Module View. The
`viewTG` command calls `LogicManager#execute(String)`.

Step 2. The contents of the `String` is parsed in `ViewTutorialGroupCommandParser#parse(String)`. This method creates a
new `Index` object with the parsed arguments. A `ViewTutorialGroupCommand` object is then initialised with this `Index`
object.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute(String)` calls the `ViewTutorialGroupCommand#execute(Model)` method of the
`ViewTutorialGroupCommand` object.

Step 4. Within `Model`, the method `Model#setViewToTutorialGroup(Module)` is executed and this displays all the tutorial
groups of the target `Module`.

Step 5. `ViewTutorialGroupCommand#execute(Model)` creates a `CommandResult` object and the `CommandResult` is returned
to `LogicManager`.

> Note: There are some differences for the view command of `Student` during Step 4.
>
> For `Student`:
> - Within each `TutorialGroup`, there is an `UniqueStudentList`.
> - The `Model` will check if the user is currently in the Student View using `Model#isInStudentView()`. This ensures
> that there is a target `Module` and `TutorialGroup` for the `Student` to be viewed from.
> - `Model#setViewToStudent(TutorialGroup)` method then displays all the students of the target `Module` and 
> `TutorialGroup`.

### Section 5.7 - Clear Command - `clear`

#### Overview

The Clear command in Trackr enables users to easily clears all data. Users will be able to erase all data in one simple command.

#### Implementation
The Clear command is the same for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student`, which falls under `ClearCommand`
The command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `ClearCommand` of Trackr.

### Section 5.8 - Exit Command - `exit`

#### Overview

The Exit command in Trackr enables users to easily exit the app. Users will be able to close the application. Data will be
saved automatically.

#### Implementation
The Exit command is the same for `Module`, `TutorialGroup`, and `Student`, which falls under `ExitCommand`
The command class extends `Command`.

Given below is an example of the interaction between the Model and the `ExitCommand` of Trackr.

### Section 5.9 - Data saving and loading

#### Implementation

The data saving and loading mechanism is facilitated by `JsonModuleStorage`. It has the operations to save and read data written in Json format to represent modules and their attributes such as tutorial groups and students, stored internally in `StorageManager` as a `moduleStorage`. Additionally it implements the following operations:

- `JsonModuleStorage#getModuleFilePath()` — Obtains the file path of which the Json file representing the data is to be saved to.
- `JsonModuleStorage#readModuleList()` — Reads the Json file found in the stores file path representing the module list and returns a ReadOnlyTrackr&lt;Module&gt; representing the modules saved in the Json file along with their attributes such as tutorial groups and students.
- `JsonModuleStorage#saveModuleList(ReadOnlyTrackr<Module> moduleList)` — Writes the Json file representing the module list based on the `ReadOnlyTrackr<Module>` passed into the operation, saving the Json file representing the modules along with their attributes such as tutorial groups and students in the stored file path.

These operations are exposed in the `ModuleStorage` interface as `ModelStorage#getModuleFilePath()`, `ModelStorage#readModuleList()` and `ModuleStorage#saveModuleList(ReadOnlyTrackr<Module> moduleList)` respectively.

The data stored in `JsonModuleStorage` is designed in a nested manner, `JsonModuleStorage` contains `JsonSerializableModuleList` which is a class that is used by the `Jackson` class for conversion to and from the Json format. `JsonSerializableModuleList` stores a list of `JsonAdaptedModule` which stores a list of `JsonAdaptedTutorialGroup` which stores a list of `JsonAdaptedStudent` which also stores a list of `JsonAdaptedTag`. Due to the nature of this nesting all these attributes are stored in a single Json file which branches out to these attributes, stored in a file called `modulelist.json`.

Saving and loading is done by the external class `JsonUtil`, who's static methods allow for the conversion of data in Json files. The methods used are:

- `JsonUtil#readJsonFile(Path filePath, Class<T> classOfObjectToDeserialize)` — Reads the Json file found at the file path, and converts it into the object of class T by using an `ObjectMapper`.
- `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile(T jsonFile, Path filePath)` — Converts the object of class T into a Json file at the file path using the `FileUtil`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the load mechanism behaves in every step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The MainApp will seek for a ModuleStorage and pass it to the StorageManager who will call `readModuleList(Path filePath)` to attempt to read module data from the Json file. If the file does not already exist, a new Json file is created.

Step 2. The `JsonSerializableModuleList` is broken down into individual `JsonAdaptedModule` objects that are also converted into `Module` objects. To fill these modules with their identity fields such as `moduleId`, the Json file is read and the values of the fields are used to construct the `Module`. For the data fields such as the list of `TutorialGroup` objects, the list of `JsonAdaptedTutorialGroup` is converted into their corresponding class `TutorialGroup`.

Step 3. The process is repeated in `JsonAdaptedTutorialGroup` to obtain the list of Student objects by converting `JsonAdaptedStudent` objects.

Step 4. Once all layers of the Json objects have been converted to their corresponding class, the module list is ready and is used by `StorageManager`, available to be used by `ModelManager` in future to display these objects in the UI.

The following activity diagram summarizes how data from the Json file is read and loaded when a user starts up the application:

![LoadJsonActivityDiagram](images/LoadJsonActivityDiagram.png)
<figcaption> Figure 5.9a Activity Diagram of data saving and loading</figcaption>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How the Json file is structured.

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire module list in a single file, nesting all internal components.
    -   Pros: Easy to implement due to abstraction allowing conversion process to be done.
    -   Cons: Easier for file to get corrupted, and will lead to massive lost of data should data corruption occur.

-   **Alternative 2:** Saving lists of modules, tutorial groups, and students in separate Json files.
    -   Pros: Easier to test each list individually to check the Json structure of each object type, and data corruption will lead to only data in separate lists to be lost (e.g. A corrupted `TutorialGroup` list will lead to no loss in the `Module` list)
    -   Cons: Difficult to reconstruct the Json classes into the native classes and more data required to be stored for `StorageManager` to know which objects belong to which (e.g. Which `Module` a `TutorialGroup` belongs to).
