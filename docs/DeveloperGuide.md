## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`, `FlashcardViewCard` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FlashcardDeckParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the flashcard deck data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The Model class diagram shown above omits details of the Flashcard class due to space constraint. Instead, the omitted details have been extracted and are shown here:<br>

</div>

![FlashcardClassDiagram](images/FlashcardClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FlashcardDeck`, which `Flashcard` references. This allows `FlashcardDeck` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Flashcard` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

</div>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the flashcard deck data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.flashcard.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Add feature 

#### Current Implementation

The add feature is facilitated by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`. The add command supports the following inputs from the user

* `q/QUESTION`
* `a/ANSWER`
* `c/CATEGORY`
* `n/NOTE`
* `r/RATING`
* `d/DIAGRAM`
* `t/TAG`

Question and answer are mandatory inputs while the rest are optional inputs. When the user adds a flashcard, the user’s inputs will be passed on to `ParserUtil`. `ParserUtil` will conduct input validation and trim any leading and trailing whitespaces. If the user’s inputs are valid and there are no duplicate flashcard, a `Flashcard` object will be created and added to the `FlashcardDeck`. Otherwise `ParseException` will be thrown and the relevant error message will be displayed to the user. 

It implements the following operations:
* `AddCommand#execute()` - Add the flashcard to the `ModelManager` and `FlashcardDeck`
* `AddCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Conduct input validation and parse user’s input

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2: The user executes `add q/OOP is good. T/F ? a/T` command to add a flashcard with question “OOP is good.T/F ?” and answer “T” . `LogicManager` calls `FlashcardDeckParser#parseCommand(String args))` which calls
`AddCommandParser#parse(String args)` .

Step 3. `AddCommandParser` calls `ParserUtil#parseAnswer` and `ParserUtil#parseQuestion` to check for input validation. If input validation is successful, `AddCommandParser` calls the constructor of `Flashcard` and creates a flashcard. Consequently, a new `AddCommand` with the flashcard as the parameter is created.

Step 4: `LogicManager` then calls `AddCommand#execute(Model model)`.

Step 5: `AddCommand` then add a flashcard to the flashcard deck by calling `Model#addFlashcard`.

Step 6: A `CommandResult` is generated and Model updates the `filteredFlashcardList` by adding the flashcard which is then updated in the UI.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Implemented\] Review feature

#### Current Implementation

The review feature is one of the two abstract study features. The review feature is facilitated by `StudyManager` which
keeps track of the review state. `StudyManager` maintains the list of `Flashcard` and the `currentIndex` at which the user is at.
The review feature also involves the UI via `ReviewPanel` which will handle user input and displaying of the flashcards.

`StudyManager` implements the following operations:
* `StudyManager#hasNextFlashcard` - determines if there are any more flashcards in the flashcard list after the flashcard specified by the `currentIndex`
* `StudyManager#hasPreviousFlashcard` - determines if there are any previous flashcards in the flashcard list before the flashcard specified by the `currentIndex`
* `StudyManager#getCurrentFlashcard` - returns flashcard at `currentIndex` in the flashcard list
* `StudyManager#getPreviousFlashcard` - decrements `currentIndex` by 1 and returns the associated flashcard
* `StudyManager#getNextFlashcard` - increments `currentIndex` by 1 and returns the associated flashcard

The following class diagrams show how the relationship between the different UI components involved in review, and `StudyManager`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

![ReviewClassDiagram](images/ReviewClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example of how the review mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `review` command. `MainWindow` will receive a `CommandResult` and calls `CommandResult#isReviewMode` which returns true. A new `ReviewPanel` 
is created and `MainWindow#enterStudyMode(StudyPanel studyPanel)` is then called with this `ReviewPanel`, to enter review mode.

Step 3. In `MainWindow#enterStudyMode`, the UI elements are altered to show the review user interface. In `ReviewPanel` a listener is set 
up to listen for arrow key presses, and a new `StudyManager` is created to keep track of state.

Step 4. Depending on the key presses, different operations of `StudyManager` are called. The flashcard to render in the 
UI is determined by the various `StudyManager` operations and the state as mentioned above.

Step 5. If user presses `q`, `StudyPanel#exitStudyMode` is called which in turn calls `MainWindow#exitReviewMode`, 
which places the application back in normal command mode.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram gives an overview of how the application enters review mode:

![ReviewSequenceDiagram](images/ReviewSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarises the control path in review mode set up by `ReviewPanel` and `StudyManager`:

![ReviewActivityDiagram](images/ReviewActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How review mode executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Handle review mode directly in UI.
  * Pros: Truly interactive review where user can use key presses instead of typing commands.
  * Cons: UI will have to implement some logic.

* **Alternative 2:** Handle review mode through the command textbox.
  * Pros: Allows for better abstraction through separation of UI and logic.
  * Cons: Poorer user experience as reviewing will be slow since user has to type in command one by one.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Implemented\] Sort feature

#### Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. `Statistics` attribute is stored internally in `Flashcard`, to keep track of review frequency and correctness percentage respectively based on the quiz activity done by the user. When the user enters quiz mode, the user activity will be tracked and the data will be sent and stored inside `Statistics` of the individual `Flashcard`. This activity will then be used to facilitate the sort mechanism, through the enum `SortCriteria` which provides the comparator needed for the respective sort critera.

It implements the following operations:
* `ModelManager#sortFilteredFlashcardList(Comparator <Flashcard> comparator)` - sorts the flashcard list according to the given comparator, and updates the flashcard list shown.
* `SortCriteria#getCriteria(String criteria)` - retrieves the enum according to the criteria given.

The `ModelManager#sortFilteredFlashcardList(Comparator<Flashcard> comparator)` operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateSortedFlashcardList(Comparator <Flashcard> comparator)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `quiz` command to quiz the flashcard deck. The user quizzes 3 out of 5 flashcards and exits quiz mode. The quiz command calls `Statistics#incrementReviewFrequency()` for each flashcard that has been reviewed and `Statistics#incrementSuccessFrequency()` depending on whether the user successfully answers the question, hence updating the state of the flashcard.

Step 3. The user executes `sort reviewed -d`. The command gets parsed to retrieve the appropriate `SortCriteria`. The `sort` command calls `Model#sortFilteredFlashcardList` with this `SortCriteria`, causing the flashcards to be sorted by review frequency, in descending order.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores statistics in Flashcard and compares flashcard directly.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Flashcard will have to keep track of many data.

* **Alternative 2:** Using a data structure (e.g. HashMap) to store statistics.
  * Pros: Will use more memory, since the HashMap will have to be committed to local storage too.
  * Cons: We must ensure that the any changes/updates to a flashcard will be reflected in the HashMap.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Implemented\] Favourite/Unfavourite feature 

#### Current Implementation

The favourite/unfavourite mechanism is faciliated by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`.
A `isFavourite` boolean attribute is stored internally in `Flashcard`, to keep track of whether the flashcard is favourited. When the user favourites a flashcard, `isFavourite` is set to true, and set to false otherwise. 
 
It implements the following operations:
* `Flashcard#isFavourite()` - Checks whether the current flashcard is favourited.
* `FavCommand#createFavouriteFlashcard(Flashcard flashcardToFavourite)` - Duplicates the flashcard and set `isFavourite` attribute to `true`.
* `UnfavCommand#createUnfavouriteFlashcard(Flashcard flashcardToUnfavourite)` - Duplicates the flashcard and set `isFavourite` attribute to `false`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the favourite and unfavourite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application 

![FavUnfavState0](images/FavUnfavState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2: The user executes `fav 1` command to favourite the 1st flashcard in the displayed flashcard deck. `fav` command calls 
`Flashcard#isFavourite()` method to check whether the flashcard at index 1, `f1`,  has been favourited. If the flashcard is not favourited, 
`fav` command calls `FavCommand#createFavouriteFlashcard(f1)` to create a new flashcard, `fav1`,  by duplicating the existing data fields and set the `isFavourite` attribute to `true`.
`fav` command then calls `ModelManager#setFlashcard(f1, fav1)` to replace the current flashcard, `f1`,  with the favourited flashcard, `fav1`.

![FavUnfavState1](images/FavUnfavState1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `fav` operation works:

![FavouriteSequenceDiagram](images/FavouriteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 3: The user executes `unfav 1` command to unfavourite the 1st flashcard in the displayed flashcard deck. `unfav` command calls 
`Flashcard#isFavourite()` method to check whether the flashcard at index 1, `fav1`,  has been favourited. `fav1` is favourited in step 2, hence, 
`unfav` command calls `UnfavCommand#createUnfavouriteFlashcard(fav1)` to create a new flashcard, `f1`,  by duplicating the existing data fields and set the `isFavourite` attribute to `false`.
`unfav` command then calls `ModelManager#setFlashcard(fav1, f1)` to replace the current flashcard, `fav1`,  with the unfavourited flashcard, `f1`.

![FavUnfavState2](images/FavUnfavState2.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a favourite/unfavourite command:

![FavouriteUnfavouriteActivityDiagram.png](images/FavouriteUnfavouriteActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How fav & unfav executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new flashcard everytime `isFavourite` value changes
  * Pros: Flashcard remains immutable.
  * Cons: Execution time is longer compared to Alternative 2 since a new flashcard is created if flashcard's state changes.

* **Alternative 2:** Toggle `isFavourite` using a setter such as `setFavouriteStatus` in `Flashcard`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement as there is no need to create a new flashcard every time the state is changed.
  * Cons: Flashcard would not be immutable

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Implemented\] Filter feature

#### Current Implementation
The filtering mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`.
It works when the `LogicManager` listens for a filter command input from the user and
parses the command to filter out relevant flashcards based on the category, rating, favourite status and/or tags.

The filter feature supports filtering of multiple flashcard fields by parsing the command using `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)`
and creates a new `FilterCommand` object that contains a `MultipleFieldsEqualKeywordsPredicate` predicate object.

The `MultipleFieldsEqualKeywordsPredicate` predicate object then encapsulates the following predicate objects:
* `CategoryEqualsKeywordsPredicate`
* `RatingEqualsKeywordsPredicate` 
* `FavouriteEqualsKeywordsPredicate`
* `TagsEqualKeywordsPredicate`

It implements the following operations:
* `FilterCommand#execute(Model model)` to update `Model` to show only the filtered flashcards
* `MultipleFieldsEqualKeywordsPredicate#test(Flashcard flashcard)` to check every flashcard in `Model` against the 
various encapsulated predicates for different fields in the flashcard (category, rating, favourite status and tags) and will only
return true if all encapsulated predicates return true.
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredFlashcardList(Predicate<Flashcard> predicate)` takes in a predicate to update 
`filteredFlashcards` attribute within  `ModelManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2: The user executes `filter c/SDLC r/3` command to filter and display all the flashcards in the flashcard deck
belonging to SDLC category and have a rating of 3. `LogicManager` calls   `FlashcardDeckParser#parseCommand(String args))` and   
`FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` to ultimately return a `FilterCommand` object.

Step 3: After parsing, `LogicManager` then calls `FilterCommand#execute(Model model)`.

Step 4: `FilterCommand` then updates the list of filtered flashcards by calling 
`Model#updateFilteredFlashcardList(predicate)`.

Step 5: A `CommandResult` is generated and Model updates the `filteredFlashcardList` which is then updated
in the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

## **Appendix: Effort**

This section documents the effort in morphing AB3 to SWEe! .

**General refactor of AB3 to SWEe!**
* Morph from an address book to a flashcard app.
* All instances of AddressBook and related words such as Person, Address, Email, Phone Number (and many more) had to be removed or refactored.
* This involved not only renaming the relevant methods and variables **throughout the project** but also entire classes, packages and documentation.
* Eg. The entire `Person` class in AB3 had to be morphed into `Flashcard` class with entirely new methods, parameters and variables.
* Eg. The `add` and `edit` commands (and their associated parsers) had to be rewritten as it was originally used to add/edit a `Person` but now they are used to add/edit a `Flashcard`.
* Eg. New attributes in `Flashcard` class include `question`, `answer`, `rating`, `category`, `note`, `isFavourite`, `statistics`, `diagram`. These new attributes required unique parsing and validation.

**`Quiz` and `Review` feature**
* These 2 features are completely new in functionality relative to AB3 features.
* They involved much UI work as we had to design an entirely new screen. Our app now has 2 distinct screens as compared to the 1 screen of AB3.
* It was challenging to integrate these 2 features as they were not a conventional command to type into the commandbox:
  * We had to handle keyboard input outside of the command box in these 2 features which is a functionality not present in AB3.
  * We had to design a new pattern to activate these 2 commands and execute them (read [Review implementation](#implemented-review-feature)).
  * Creation of an entirely new logic component `StudyManager` to handle the logic of these 2 features.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**`View` and `Stats` feature**
* The main challenge in these 2 features was to create a new UI.
* AB3 did not have a detailed view for an entity in the list.
* We had to split the UI of the originally AB3 into 2 columns, one for the list and one for the output of `View` and `Stats`.

**Diagrams in flashcards**
* Our app allows adding and viewing images which AB3 did not.
* Implementing diagrams was challenging as we had to do many checks to make sure the file path provided was present and had a valid image.
* We also had to made sure the diagrams were sized appropriately on the UI.

**`Filter` feature**
* AB3 did not have a filter feature by fields of the entity. 
* We implemented a filter that will filter for flashcards that match all fields specified by you.
* We had to design and learn how to implement this feature by taking reference from the `find` feature in AB3.

**`Sort` feature**
* AB3 did not have a sort feature.
* We had to integrate the sort feature with the filter feature which was quite challenging as we had to ensure that the 2 features could be used together (ie. using one feature did not prevent the other from being used). This involved diving into `ModelManager` and making changes.
 
**General UI enhancements**
* Significant styling was done to make our app look better compared to AB3.
* We also ensured proper scaling of our app to different windows sizes, with the ability to scroll some panes.
