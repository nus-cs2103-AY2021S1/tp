SimplyKitchen is a desktop app for food inventory management, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
With intuitive and practical features, SimplyKitchen can get food management tasks done faster and more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

SimplyKitchen aims to aid the domestic individuals who manage their kitchens at home by providing an apt food inventory management system.
We have taken into consideration the common problems our target audience may face while managing their kitchen, and have created specialized features in our application in order to address those problems.
Since it is meant for general households, care has been taken to make the app more intuitive and not overwhelming to facilitate comfortable usage for all.
We hope to make SimplyKitchen a household name in Singapore and appreciate your assistance in helping us do so!

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ExpiringFoodListPanel`, `ExpiredFoodListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FoodInventoryParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food item).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the food inventory data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FoodInventory`, which `Food` references. This allows `FoodInventory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
</div>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)



### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/simplykitchen/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the food inventory data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.simplykitchen.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/Redo feature

#### Implementation

The feature is implemented with a `VersionedFoodInventory`. The `VersionedFoodInventory` contains the different states of the food inventory. The states are stored in a `foodInventoryStateList` and the current state is tracked with a `currentStatePointer`. It also implements the following methods:

* `VersionedFoodInventory#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current food inventory state in its states list.
* `VersionedFoodInventory#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous food inventory state from its states list.
* `VersionedFoodInventory#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone food inventory state from its states list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFoodInventory()`, `Model#undoFoodInventory()` and `Model#redoFoodInventory()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFoodInventory` will be initialized with the initial food inventory state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single food inventory state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th food item in the food inventory. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitFoodInventory()`, causing the modified state of the food inventory after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `foodInventoryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted food inventory state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add d/Donut â€¦â€‹` to add a new food item. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitFoodInventory()`, causing another modified food inventory state to be saved into the `foodInventoryStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFoodInventory()`, so the food inventory state will not be saved into the `foodInventoryStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the food item was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFoodInventory()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous food inventory state, and restores the food inventory to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial food inventory state, then there are no previous food inventory states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFoodInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather

than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoFoodInventory()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the food inventory to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `foodInventoryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest food inventory state, then there are no undone food inventory states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFoodInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the food inventory, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitFoodInventory()`, `Model#undoFoodInventory()` or `Model#redoFoodInventory()`. Thus, the `foodInventoryStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFoodInventory()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `foodInventoryStateList`, all food inventory states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add d/Donut â€¦â€‹` command.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire food inventory.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the food item being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### Sorting feature

#### Implementation

The sorting feature consists of three commands, `SortDescCommand`, `SortExpiryCommand` and `SortPriorityCommand` which extend `Command`.

The sorting order is in accordance to what is likely the most useful order for the user.

Thus, `SortDescCommand` sorts the list of food displayed by description, then by expiry date from oldest to newest, followed by priority from `HIGH` to `LOW`.

Similarly, `SortExpiryCommand` sorts the list of food displayed by expiry date from oldest to newest, followed by priority from `HIGH` to `LOW`, followed by description.

Similarly, `SortPriorityCommand` sorts the list of food displayed by priority from `HIGH` to `LOW`, followed by expiry date from oldest to newest, followed by description.

When the commands are executed by calling `SortDescCommand#execute(Model model)` or `SortExpiryCommand#execute(Model model)` or `SortPriorityCommand#execute(Model model)`, the `versionedFoodInventory` attribute in `model` is sorted.

This is done so by calling `model#sortFoodInventory(Comparator<Food>... comparators)` method in `model` with the relevant `comparators` for sorting.

`model#setSortingComparators(Comparator<Food>[] sortingComparators)` and `userPref#setSortingComparatorsDescription(String sortingComparatorsDescription)` are then called to save the sorting information.

Sorting of the `versionedFoodInventory` attribute in `model` is reflected in the GUI when `MainWindow` calls `logic#getFilteredFoodList()`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the command `sortdesc` works:

![SortDescSequenceDiagram](images/SortDescSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

Comparators used for sorting are stored as static variables in `ComparatorUtil`, allowing for the code to be scalable for future sorting orders.

Sorting information is stored as user preferences, to allow for the information to be retained when the application closes. Thus, the user's preferred sorting mechanism is stored, to enhance user experience.

Furthermore, this helps for items added or edited by calling `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` in the list to be updated dynamically according to the sorting mechanism. Thus, the user does not need to sort the list again.

##### Aspect: Permanence of list sorting

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Permanently sort lists.
  * Pros: Less hassle if a specific sorting order is preferred by the user.
  * Cons: User is unable to sort lists after executing `FindCommand` or `ListCommand`, a likely useful feature for the user, as sorting is useful for narrowed down lists.
    However, they may achieve the same result by first sorting, then executing `FindCommand` or `ListCommand`

* **Alternative 2:** Lists are sorted by description by default, and sorting by priority or expiry date are reflected in displayed lists temporarily.
  * Pros: User may sort the items on displayed lists, after executing `FindCommand` or `ListCommand`.
  * Cons: Sorting is not permanent, thus lists stored are sorted by description by default.

### Quantity Field in Food Items

A `quantity` field for food items is implemented to track the dynamic changes in the quantity of a food in the FoodInventory.

#### Implementation:

The `quantity` field has been implemented as a class in the `model.food` package.

* Quantity class contains 2 attributes: `value` and `unit`.
* The `value` has to be a positive number. It can be an integer or a decimal value.
* The `unit` in quantity field is optional. If provided, it must consist of only alphabets. Numbers, space and special characters are not permitted.
* If the unit is not provided, a default unit - `unit` - will be given.

#### Implementation Rationale:

The constraints above have been applied after careful consideration of the needs of the target audience.

* The `value` in the quantity field must be a positive value. A negative or zero value does not carry any meaning and would defeat the purpose of the feature.
* Users would want to track the quantity precisely in some cases. To allow this, SimplyKitchen accepts decimal values as the `value` attribute.
* The `value` attribute in the Quantity field has been stored as a `double` value.
* Users will have different kinds of units while tracking the quantity of their food items. For example, kg, can, bottle etc.
* To ensure the user's freedom in choosing the unit, the `unit` attribute in the Quantity class has been stored as a `String` field.
* Constraints on the content of the `unit` field have been applied to prevent misuse of the feature.
* Units are always single words and do not contain special characters or numbers. Hence, these restrictions have been enforced while accepting a quantity from the user.
* The `unit` field is optional to relieve the user of extra work of giving a unit in intuitive cases. For example, while storing the quantity of fish a unit is intuitively the number of fish.

#### Design Consideration:

##### Aspect: Implementation

* <b>Alternative 1 (current choice): </b> Value and unit stored as double and string fields in the Quantity class.
    * Pros: Easy to implement given the tight project timeframe.
    * Cons: Less OOP compared to the other alternative.
* <b>Alternative 2: </b> Value and Unit extracted to different classes. Quantity class' attributes are objects of these Value and Unit classes.
    * Pros: Improves OOP aspect of the code.
    * Cons: Unnecessarily complicates the code.

### Change quantity feature

The change quantity feature allows users to increment or decrement the quantity of a food item by a certain amount.

#### Implementation:

The `ChangeQuantityCommandParser` class parses the command by first extracting the index of the food item within the food list displayed to the user.

Next, the `amount` is parsed. It is a non-zero signed double value.

* Having a quantity change of zero is meaningless.
* The signed value is used to denote the increment or decrement of the quantity value.
* The amount value is constrained to a maximum of 2 decimal places. Any additional decimal places used will not be meaningful from the user's point of view.
* A unit is not required as it can be derived from the existing unit of the food item when the user wants to change its quantity.

A new `ChangeQuantityCommand` object is created with the extracted index and amount. It will retrieve the correct food item from the filtered list of food item provided by the `model` object.

The selected food item will have its quantity updated through the `changeQuantityCommand#updateQuantity` method.
The method will check if the new quantity is less than or equal to zero, in which it will throw a `ParseException` to notify the user that the updated quantity cannot go below 0.
If the new quantity is 0, the user will also be prompted to use the `delete` command to delete the food item instead of setting the quantity to 0.

#### Design Consideration:

Although the quantity of a food item can be changed using the `edit` command, the command will replace the old quantity value with a value supplied by the user.
This means that users have to calculate the quantity themselves and calculation errors may occur as a result.
To minimise such errors and improve the intuitiveness of commands, the `changeqty` command allows users to specify **how much the quantity should change by**.
This allows users to not be burdened by calculations and to focus more on having an accurate inventory stock level.

##### Aspect: Modifying a food item's quantity

* <b>Alternative 1 (current choice): </b> Extract the value from the `quantity` object, update it and append it to the unit of the same object.
    * Pros: Easy to implement given the tight project timeframe.
    * Cons: Violates Law of Demeter when extracting relevant fields from the `quantity` object.
* <b>Alternative 2: </b> Use a `Descriptor` class similar to the `EditFoodDescriptor` in the `EditCommand` class.
    * Pros: Improves OOP aspect of the code.
    * Cons: Unnecessarily complicates the code.
    * Cons: Only the quantity field of a `food` object is changed so a `Descriptor` class may be an overkill.
    * Cons: The Law of Demeter will still be violated and this problem is merely transferred from one place to another.

### Find feature

The find feature allows users to search for food items based on description, expiration date, priority and/or tags.

#### Implementation:

The find feature is achieved by setting a `predicate` on the `filteredList` located in `ModelManager`. This can be done using the method `ModelManager#updateFilteredFoodList(Predicate<Food> predicate)`, which uses the parameter as the `predicate`. There are four valid predicates, namely `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ExpirySearchPredicate`, `PrioritySearchPredicate` and `TagSearchPredicate`, all of which implement the `Predicate<Food>` interface. Based on the user's `find` command, each of the `predicate` is generated with the relevant search parameters. Then, the `FindCommand#combinePredicates()` method will combine all the predicates into a single `predicate` and is passed to `ModelManager#updateFilteredFoodList(Predicate<Food> predicate)`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the command `find d/apple e/30-9-2020 p/medium t/frozen` works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Find command

The `find` command uses `ArgumentMultimap` to get the parameters of each `prefix`, similar to the `add` command. The `find` command needs to have at least one `prefix` present. If a `prefix` is present, then its respective `predicate` will be generated.

The following is the class diagram for the Find feature:

![FindClasseDiagram](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

#### Implementation Rationale:

Since the user can search for food items based on either the description, expiration date, priority or tags, the `find` command should allow searching for one or more of the above combination. This increases the flexibility in the `find` command, which allows the user to define the specificity of their search.

#### Design Consideration:

Each parameter of the search can be mapped to a `predicate`. This allows for scalability in the future as when a new attribute is added to `Food`, a new `predicate` implementing the `Predicate<Food>` interface can be created to search for this field without affecting the `predicates` of the other attributes.

##### Aspect: Implementation

* <b>Alternative 1 (current choice): </b> The expiry date in the `find` command looks for a single specific expiry date.
    * Pros: Easy to implement and search is more specific.
    * Cons: If the user wants to get all the expiring food items in a certain period, multiple searches will be required.
* <b>Alternative 2: </b> The expiry date in the `find` command can be a date range.
    * Pros: Able to get all the food items that are going to expire in a certain period with one search.
    * Cons: Will need more validation to ensure the date range provided is valid.
