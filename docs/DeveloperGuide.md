## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores FaculType data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI
 can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save FaculType data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find contacts by attributes feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser`. It allows users to search for contacts by
 their respective attributes. It uses `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate p)` which is
  exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredList(Predicate p)`. The method updates the
  current person list and filters it according to the given predicate which will then be shown accordingly in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find by attributes operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** AND Searching from multiple attributes and keywords.
  * Pros: Provides the ability to narrow down search results by adding more keywords and attributes.
  * Cons: Unable to search for multiple persons with different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** AND Searching across attributes, OR Searching between keywords.
  * Pros: Provides the ability to narrow down search results by adding more attributes as well as expanding the search
   scope by adding more keywords (i.e: more flexible).
  * Cons: A possible source of confusion as they use different searching methods.

Both options are equally feasible. However, Alternative 1 was chosen to avoid confusion for prospective users.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find modules by attributes feature

#### Implementation

The find module mechanism is facilitated by `FindModCommand` and `FindModCommandParser`. It allows users to search for modules based on their respective attributes which are the module code, module name and instructors of the module.
It uses `ModelManager#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate p)` which is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate p)`.
The method updates the active semester module list and filters it according to the given predicate which will then be reflected accordingly in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find module by module attributes operation works:

![FindmodSequenceDiagram](images/FindmodSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindModCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a findmod command:

![FindmodActivityDiagram](images/FindmodActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How findmod executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** AND searching from multiple attributes and AND searching between keywords for module name and instructor attributes. Module code attribute only allows single keywords.
  * Pros : Provides the ability to narrow down the search results by adding more attributes and keywords. Single keyword for module code attribute allows for more focused module code searches.
  * Cons : Unable to have a more general search and unable to search for multiple modules with different module codes.

* **Alternative 2:** And searching across attributes and OR searching between keywords for module name and instructor attributes.
  * Pros : Provides the ability for a very general and flexible search.
  * Cons : Unable to have a more focused search, might be more confusing for the user to narrow down his/her searches.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete modules feature

#### Implementation

The delete module mechanism is facilitated by the `DelmodCommand` and the `DelmodCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#removeModule()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModule()`.
Then, the `removeModuleWithCode()` operation is called in the active semester `UniqueModuleList`. `UniqueModuleList#removeModuleWithCode()` will remove the module with the specified code
from the module list.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how the delete module mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application. FaculType has the module `CS2103` in the active semester.

2. The user executes the command `delmod m/CS2103` to delete the module with the module code `CS2103`.

3. The `DelmodCommand` then calls `Model#deleteModule()` after checking for the existence of the specified module.

4. The module with the specified module code will be deleted from the active semester `UniqueModuleList` in `AddressBook`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the deleting of the module works:

![DelmodSequenceDiagram](images/DelmodSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DelmodCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delmod command:

![DelmodActivityDiagram](images/DelmodActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: What the delmod command deletes by
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes a module based on the module code.
  * Pros : More intuitive to the Dean to delete by the module code.
  * Cons : Would be more troublesome to look for the module should the Dean forget the module code.

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes a module based on the index of the module list.
  * Pros : Dean does not have to memorise all the module code, can simply delete based on what is shown in the module list.
  * Cons : Less intuitive.

### Assign feature

#### Implementation

The assign feature is facilitated by `AssignCommand` and `AssignCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#assignInstructor()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#assignInstructor()`.
Then, the `assignInstructor()` operation is called in both `UniqueModuleList` and `Module`. `Module#assignInstructor()` will add the instructor to the module's set of instructors.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the assign operation works:

![AssignSequenceDiagram](images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AssignCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an assign command:

![AssignActivityDiagram](images/AssignActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to store assignments
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A module has a set of instructors assigned to it.
  * Pros: More efficient to list the instructors of a certain module.
  * Cons: Less efficient to list the modules of a certain instructor.

* **Alternative 2:** An instructor has a set of modules they are assigned to.
  * Pros: More efficient to list the modules of a certain instructor.
  * Cons: Less efficient to list the instructors of a certain module.

Both are equally viable options but Alternative 1 was chosen so `Person` would not have to be redesigned or have too many fields.

### Unassign feature

The unassign feature is facilitated by `UnassignCommand` and `UnassignCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#unassignInstructor()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#unassignInstructor()`.
Then, the `unassignInstructor()` operation is called in both `UniqueModuleList` and `Module`. `Module#unassignInstructor()` will remove the instructor from the module's set of instructors.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the unassign operation works:

![UnassignSequenceDiagram](images/UnassignSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UnassignCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an unassign command:

![UnassignActivityDiagram](images/UnassignActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Unassignall feature

The unassignall feature is facilitated by `UnassignallCommand` and `UnassignallCommandParser`.
It uses an operation `AddressBook#unassignAllInstructors()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#unassignAllInstructors()`.
Then, the `unassignAllInstructors()` operation is called in both `UniqueModuleList` and `Module`. `Module#unassignAllInstructors()` will remove all instructors from all modules' set of instructors.

The following sequence diagram shows how the unassignall operation works:

![UnassignallSequenceDiagram](images/UnassignallSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UnassignallCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an unassignall command:

![UnassignallActivityDiagram](images/UnassignallActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How unassignall executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Unassigns all instructors from all modules.
 * Pros : More efficient to unassign all instructors from all modules.
 * Cons : Less efficient to unassign a certain instructor from all modules he/she instructs.

* **Alternative 2:** Unassign a certain instructor from all modules he/she instructs.
 * Pros : More efficient to unassign a certain instructor from all modules he/she instructs.
 * Cons : Less efficient to unassign all instructors from all modules.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Clear all contacts feature

#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:
* `AddressBook#clearContacts()` â€” Clear all contacts from the contact list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#clearContacts()` and `UniquePersonList` class as `UniquePersonList#clearAll()`

The following sequence diagram shows how the cclear operation works:

![CclearSequenceDiagram](images/CclearSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `OneWordCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a cclear command:

![CclearActivityDiagram](images/CclearActivityDiagram.png)

### Clear all modules feature

#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:
* `AddressBook#clearMod()` â€” Clear all modules from the active semester module list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#clearMod()` and `UniqueModuleList` class as `UniqueModuleList#clearAll()`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the mclear operation works:

![MclearSequenceDiagram](images/MclearSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `OneWordCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a mclear command:

![MclearActivityDiagram](images/MclearActivityDiagram.png)

### Switch active semester feature

#### Implementation

The switch feature is facilitated by `AddressBook#switchModuleList()` which is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#switchModuleList()`.

AddressBook has two module lists, one for each semester, and one additional `UniqueModuleList` variable named `activeModules` that stores a reference to the active semester's module list. 
`AddressBook#switchModuleList()` toggles which module list is referenced by `activeModules`.
All `AddressBook` operations on `UniqueModuleList` are done on `activeModules`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the switch operation works:

![SwitchSequenceDiagram](images/SwitchSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `OneWordCommandParser` should
 end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<br/>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a switch command:

![SwitchActivityDiagram](images/SwitchActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Setting the active semester
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** There are two module lists and active semester references one of them.
  * Pros: Less code to change.
  * Cons: Can only manage the modules in the active semester.

* **Alternative 2:** There is only one module list and there is a filter to select modules of a particular semester.
  * Pros: More efficient to list the modules of a certain instructor.
  * Cons: Need to add semester field to modules and commands, will have two copies of the same module if held in both semesters, more code to change.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current FaculType state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous FaculType state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone FaculType state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial FaculType state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single FaculType state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in FaculType. The `delete` command calls
 `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of FaculType after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted FaculType state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook
()`, causing another modified FaculType state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the FaculType state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
 `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous FaculType state, and restores FaculType to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores FaculType to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest FaculType state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify FaculType, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all FaculType states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire FaculType data.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Current bugs and feature ideas**

This section describes bugs found in the current version of FaculType and
feature ideas that have been proposed but currently don't have implementation details yet.
Both of which are to be fixed/implemented in the next version of FaculType.

### Current bugs

* Editing a contact's identifying attributes (name, phone, email) to be the same as another contact's causes problems due to the detection of duplicate contacts.
This bug is inherited from the parent project AddressBook Level 3.
* A tag in a contact card and an instructor tag in a module card may be cut off if the text inside is too long or if there are too many tags.
This bug is inherited from the parent project AddressBook Level 3.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Example of the tag bug:

![TagBug](images/TagBug.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* No validation of instructor existence for modules. Adding a non-existent instructor by editing the 
`addressbook.json` file will not throw any error.

Example of the instructor bug:

![JSONFileComposite](images/JSONFileComposite.png)


![InstructorBug](images/InstructorBug.png)

### Feature ideas

* Order filter results of contacts and modules by how much they match the specified parameters (Coming soon).
* Differentiate instructor tags in module cards for instructors with the same name (Coming soon).

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Changes from AB3

The team modified some features of AB3. A person originally had a name, phone number, email, address, and tags. In FaculType, a person no longer has an address, but has a department, office, and remark.
These additional attributes required the team to change the `Person` class inside of the `Model` component, which in turn caused the other classes using `Person` to be updated as well.
The `add` and `edit` commands are modified to support these new attributes. The team has also modified the `find` command. In AB3, the find command can only `find` based on a person's name.
In FaculType, the `find` command can find persons based on any attribute they have (e.g. name, phone number, office, etc.).

The team added a new entity `Module` for module management. Modules have their own list, so now FaculType has two types of lists for persons and modules, compared to only one list for persons in AB3.
Since there are now two types of lists, the team added additional commands to complement the `clear` and `list` commands. `clear` is renamed to reset and would reset all data in FaculType.
`cclear` and `mclear` as well as `clist` and `mlist` are the respective equivalents of AB3's `clear` and `list` for the person list and the module list. 
Modules can be added and deleted with `addmod` and `delmod` The team implemented the `findmod` command which is
similar to the `find` command but for modules, and it allows searching by module attributes.

The team added `assign`, `unassign` and `unassignall` to manage the person-module relationship.
A second module list was required to implement the two-semester system. The team added `switch` to toggle between these two module lists.
All the commands above related to module management and assignment are all new features that do not exist in AB3.

The team modified the GUI to accommodate these changes, including the color scheme and overall structure. The team designed a logo for FaculType to become the program's icon.

The project is harder to develop than AB3 because FaculType has two entity types (compared to one in AB3) and the module entity type has to have two separate lists.

### Difficulties and Challenges

As most of the developer team had never worked on a brown-field project before, working on the project seemed like a monumental task at first, even with the tutorials provided.
Familiarizing oneself to the large codebase took up quite some time, and the team ended up learning the codebase while working on new features. A small change in one part of the codebase sometimes required a lot of changes in other areas of the codebase.
The fact that the software architecture was somewhat similar to that of the individual project (iP) made it slightly easier to understand.

JavaFX also proved to be difficult to master. A lot of GUI bugs occured and fixing them was very challenging.

### Effort Required

The team had to meet up at least once a week to discuss the current week's deliverables and assign each team member to certain tasks.
Some additional meetings were held for intensive manual testing of the application.
A working product had to be done by the end of each week, even if the current iteration was not finished yet. This way it was easier to identify bugs and feature changes that had to be made.

Each team member had to be ready to review PRs every day of the week and continuous communication through a chat group was necessary to ensure everybody was on the same page.
Documentation files had to be updated regularly to ensure every feature listed in the files is accurate as of the current feature's implementation.
