### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `LogListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FixMyAbsParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a log).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component,

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
- stores the logbook data.
- exposes unmodifiable lists `ObservableList<Log>` and `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in these lists change.
- does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/fma/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

- can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
- can save the logbook data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.fma.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features were implemented.

### Add Exercise feature
The adding of Exercises is one of the core functionalities of FixMyAbs. Apart from the generic exercises provided when users first start the app, users are also able to add their own exercises, which makes FixMyAbs customizable and more suited to each user's specific needs.  

The mechanism is facilitated by an `Exercise` class. An `Exercise` class has `Name` and `Calories`. Calories represent the number of calories burnt per rep of the exercise.

![AddExClassDiagram](images/AddExerciseClassDiagram.png)

A user can add an `Exercise`to the `LogBook` by executing the `addex` command.

#### Example usage scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add exercise` mechanism behaves at each step after launching the application.

Step 1. The user executes the command `addex e/Jumping kicks c/2`. `FixMyAbsParser` creates a new `AddExCommandParser` and calls the `AddExCommandParser#parse()` method.

Step 2. The user input is passed into the `AddExCommandParser#parse()` method and instances of `Name` and `Calories` are created using the `ParserUtil` class, from user input. These new instances are passed as parameters to the `Exercise` constructor, and a new `Exercise` object is created as a result.

![AddExClassDiagram](images/AddExerciseStep2.png)

Step 3. A new `AddExCommand` is returned with the created `Exercise` object as an attribute. The `Exercise` object is then added to the `Model`.

![AddExClassDiagram](images/AddExerciseStep3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Add Exercise` feature works:

![AddExClassDiagram](images/AddExerciseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddExCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Add Log feature
The adding of Logs are the core to the functionality of FixMyAbs. Users are able to add information related to that 
exercise log, which will then allow them to track their fitness progress and details regarding their workout.  

The mechanism is facilitated by a `Log` class. A `Log` class has `Exercise`, `Rep`, `Comment` and `LocalDateTime`.

![AddLogClassDiagram](images/AddLogClassDiagram.png)

A user can add a `Log`to the `LogBook` by executing the `add` command.

#### Example usage scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add log` mechanism behaves at each step after launching the application.

Step 1. The user executes the command `add e/Pushups r/50 c/Managed to increase to 50 reps today!`. `FixMyAbsParser` creates a new `AddCommandParser` and calls the `AddCommandParser#parse()` method.

Step 2. The user input is passed into the `AddCommandParser#parse()` method and instances of `Exercise`, `Rep` and `Comment` are created using the `ParserUtil` class, from user input. These new instances are passed as parameters to the `Log` constructor, and a new `Log` object is created as a result. Each `Log` instantiates with a new `dateTime` field, which calls the `LocalDateTime#now()` method alongside the current system clock of the user's computer.`

Step 3. A new `AddCommand` is returned with the created `Log` object as an attribute. The `Log` object is then added to the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Add Log` feature works:

![AddLogClassDiagram](images/AddLogSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

![](images/DeleteExDiagram.png)


### Find Log feature
To find specific logs, users are able to search for logs based on certain keywords.
This will allow them to easily find logs with a certain exercise, as well as any of its details.

![FindLogClassDiagram](images/NameContainsKeywordsPredicate.png) 

`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` supports this command.
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` checks if a Log contains all the keywords in the user input.

A user can thus find a `Log` by executing the `find` command.

#### Example usage scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `find` command behaves at each step after launching the application.

Step 1. The user executes the command `find Push ups`. `FixMyAbsParser` creates a new `FindCommandParser` and calls the `FindCommandParser#parse()` method.

Step 2. The user input is passed into the `FindCommandParser#parse()` method, which then creates a new `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object, with the user input as the parameter. This object checks if there is a match between the keyword and the tested `Log`. 

Step 3. As a result of the `FindCommandParser#parse()` method, a new `FindCommand` is returned with the created `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as an attribute. Upon calling `FindCommand#execute()`, the model is updated through `Model#updateFilteredLogList()`, and the new filtered log list is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` feature works:

![FindLogClassDiagram](images/FindLogSequenceDiagram.png) 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>



### Autocomplete  feature

Autocomplete feature uses following classes:

- `ResultDisplay` - Displays user input.
- `CommandBox` - CommandBox which consists of `commandTextField`
- `LogicManager` - Implements logic between models and user interface

Below is how it works:

Step 1. User enters command `add`.

Step 2. `commandTextField` in `CommandBox` detects changes in the user input and parse the input into
 `showAutoCompleteResult()` method in `ResultDisplay` 

Step 3: `ResultDisplay` executes method `setText` which executes `getAutoCompleteResult` method.

Step 4: `getAutoCompleteResult` computes the result to display to the user and returns the String `result`.

Step 5: `setText` method in `ResultDisplay` receives the `result` as a parameter and display the `result` for the user.

![AutocompleteSequenceDiagram](images/AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png) 

### Better user interface

We changed and improve the user interface to support exercise by adding `ExerciseListCard` and `ExerciseListPanel
` which is similar to `LogListCard` and `LogListPanel` to the
`MainWindow`.

The `UI` component works the same

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The design looks like:
