## Introduction

**ResiReg** is a productivity app designed to help OHS* admin at Residential Colleges (RCs)* in NUS with their daily tasks.

**ResiReg** has the following main features:

1. Manage records of students.
2. Manage records of rooms.
3. Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College.

## Purpose and Audience for this Guide

This Developer Guide specifies the architecture, design, implementation and use cases for **ResiReg**, as well as our considerations behind key design decisions.

It is intended for developers, software testers, open-source contributors and any like-minded students who wish to contribute this project or gain deeper insights about **ResiReg**.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-student si/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MainPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. `MainPanel` in turn is made up of the various tabs represented as `StudentListPanel`, `RoomListPanel` and `BinItemListPanel` and their constitutent parts. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

When the app is launched, `StudentListPanel` is displayed to allow the user to manage student records. When a room tab session is to be shown, `StudentListPanel` becomes hidden, and the `RoomListPanel` is displayed to allow the user to edit and view rooms, by exposing a `MainPanel#handleToggle` method to the `Logic` components.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

Notes:
- XYZCommand refers to concrete Command classes such as `AddCommand`, `ExitCommand`, etc.
- Utility classes, such as those used by the CommandParsers (eg. `CliSyntax`, `ParserUtil`, `ArgumentMultimap`, `ArgumentTokenizer`) and those used by only a few specific Commands (eg. `CreateEditCopy`) have been omitted from the diagram for clarity.

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/logic/Logic.java)

1. `LogicManager` gets a list of the current user-defined aliases from the `Model`.
1. `LogicManager` uses the list of aliases together with information from `CommandWordEnum` to generate a map of strings (representing all the possible strings that a user may use to call a command) to `Parser`s.
1. `LogicManager` passes the user input and this map to `ResiRegParser`, which parses the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add-room fl/11 n/100 t/NN")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add-room fl/11 n/100 t/NN` Command](images/AddRoomSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
- stores the ResiReg data
- exposes the following `ObservableList`s that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change:
    - unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`
    - unmodifiable `ObservableList<Room>`
    - unmodifiable `ObservableList<Allocation>`
    - unmodifiable `ObservableList<BinItem>`
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/resireg/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

- can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
- can save the ResiReg data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.resireg.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Bin Feature

#### Implementation

ResiReg allows for a bin feature, where students and rooms are moved to a bin on deletion, and persist there for a user-specified period (with a default of 30 days) before they are removed permanently. The feature is built using the `BinItem`, `UniqueBinItemList` and `JsonAdaptedBinItem` classes and an **empty** interface `Binnable`. Items that can be stored in the bin (`Student` and `Room`) implement the empty<sup>1</sup> interface `Binnable`. A `BinItem` object is created when a `Binnable` object is deleted, and it contains the Binnable object and the date of deletion (implemented as a `LocalDate`) as its attributes. Consequently, the `BinItem` is placed into `UniqueBinItemList`.

The class diagram below represents the class structure pictorially.

![image](images/BinClassDiagram.png)

The following is a run-through of a typical user session where ResiReg is started, a student is deleted and moved to the bin, and then the user restores the student from the bin. Note that the sequence is the same for when a room is deleted and restored.

Step 1. On launching ResiReg, `ModelManager` calls `ModelManager#deleteExpiredItems()` during initialization. This method iterates through `UniqueBinItemList` and removes all bin items which have expired (i.e they have persisted in the bin for more days than the user-specified cutoff) by calling `UniqueBinItemList#remove()` for the expired object.

Step 2. The user executes the `delete 1` command to delete the first student in ResiReg. 
The `delete` command calls the constructor of `BinItem` with the deleted student to create a new `BinItem` object. The `dateDeleted` attribute is initialized with the current system time. 

Step 3. The `delete` command then adds the new `BinItem` object to the `UniqueBinItemList` by first checking for uniqueness (as a defensive precaution) and calling `Model#addBinItem(studentToBin)`.

The sequence diagram given below represents this process of deleting a student (steps 2 and 3).

![image](images/BinDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 4. The user executes a few other commands. He then cognizes that he has erroneously deleted the student, and doesn't wish to execute the `undo` command multiple times. He then navigates to the Bin tab, (by executing `bin`) and executes the `restore` command to retrieve the `Student` item from the bin. 

Step 5. The `execute` method of `RestoreCommand` removes the `itemToRestore` from `UniqueBinItemList` by caling `Model#deleteBinItem(itemToRestore)`. The student item is retrieved by calling an instance method, `itemToRestore.getBinnedItem()` and typecasted to a `Student` object. 

Step 6. The Ui is updated accordingly, since both the `UniqueBinItemList` and `UniqueStudentList` follow the Observer pattern. 

The following sequence diagram shows how a restore command operates.

![image](images/BinRestoreSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>1</sup> Refer below for the design decision of maintaining an empty interface (which enforces no method or variable definitions). 

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: Handling the storage of bin items
Problem Statement: A bin item must be polymorphic in its storage, i.e., it must be capable of serializing and deserializing multiple types of data (`Student`s as well as `Room`s). However, JSON does not support polymorphic storage natively, and a concrete serializable type must be provided during read/write operations. This leads to the problem of how to store `Binnable` instances whose concrete type is not known.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reusing storage classes for `Room` and `Student` and typecasting explicitly

  - Pros: Allows a clean separation of concerns since the `Binnable` interface does not need to contain information about storage.  This removes  the need to repeat code by creating storage classes such as `JsonAdaptedStudentBin` and `JsonAdaptedRoomBin` dedicated to storing objects in the Bin only. In other words, it makes the Ui, Logic and Model structure OOP-compliant. Further, it results in more efficient testing (since storage tests for `Student` and `Room` objects need not be re-written)
  - Cons: Doesn't scale well since if new types of `Binnable` objects are to be handled by the system (e.g. `Bills`), then multiple storage-related files will have to be modified to allow for the new object to have robust type-checking and storage. In other words, it makes the storage less OOP-compliant. 

- **Alternative 2:** Assigning storage responsibility to the `Binnable` interface
  - Pros: Makes storage more OOP-compliant, prevents need for explicit type-checking. 
  - Cons: Complicates the general MVC structure, and makes it more difficult to migrate to non-JSON storage, since instances of `Binnable` (e.g. `Student` and `Room`) must now contain their storage implementation details as well. 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Allocation/ Deallocation/ Reallocation Feature

The allocation/ deallocation/ reallocation feature is facilitated by `Allocation`. It is an association class of the
unique identifiers of a `Student` and a `Room` to which the `Student` is allocated to. The `Allocation` association
class includes the `Student`'s `StudentId` and the allocated `Room`'s `Floor` and `RoomNumber`.

#### Implementation

When a `Student` is allocated a `Room` using `AllocateCommand`, an `Allocation` instance is created and added to the
`UniqueAllocationList`. Likewise, when a `Student` is deallocated or reallocated a different `Room` using `DeallocateCommand` and
`ReallocateCommand` respectively, the `Allocation` relating to the `Student` is removed from `ResiReg` in the former
and edited in the latter.

The follow class diagram shows how `Allocation` is implemented.

![image](images/AllocationClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the allocation mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `allocate si/1 ri/1` command to allocate the first student in ResiReg to the first room in ResiReg.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` executes the user input, running `parseCommand` to `AllocateCommandParser`.

Step 3. The arguments `si/1 ri/1` are parsed by `AllocateCommandParser` and the `AllocateCommand` instance is created.

Step 4. The `AllocateCommand` instance is executed in `LogicManager`, which performs 3 actions: `setStudent`, `setRoom` and `addAllocation` to the `Model`.

Step 5. A `CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how an allocate command operates.

![image](images/AllocateSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration

Aspect: How to associate the allocation between a student and a room

- **Alternative 1:** A student has a room.

  - Pros: Trivial implementation.
  - Cons: Storage redundancy as a student now has a copy of a room.

- **Alternative 2:** A room has a student.

  - Pros: Trivial implementation.
  - Cons: Storage redundancy as a room now has a copy of a student.

- **Alternative 3:** A student has a room and a room has a student.

  - Pros: Easy implementation.
  - Cons: Cyclic dependency between a room and a student.

- **Alternative 4 (final choice):** A student's room allocation is referred to by an association class.

  - Pros: Natural representation of the allocation.
  - Cons: Require more overhead code.

Having attempted a `Student` having a `Room` attribute and/or vice versa, it inevitably ends
up with a cyclic dependency in various parts of the code, such as the `Student` or `Room`'s `toString()` methods or
their `JsonAdapted` variants, which is undesired. Therefore, the room allocation functionality was refactored into
the `Allocation` association class (alternative 4).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is added to allow users of ResiReg to revert to a previous state
or return to the future state (that is the previously current state), undoing or redoing 
changes made to the state of ResiReg.

This mechanism is facilitated by `StatefulResiReg`, an instance of which is stored inside `ModelManager`. It extends `ResiReg` with an undo/redo history, for commands that
modify the state of ResiReg, which comprises of: students, rooms, allocations, semesters and bin items.

The class diagram below gives a pictorial representation of the class structure.

![UndoRedoClassDiagram](images/UndoRedoClassDiagram.png)

The state history is stored internally as `redoStatesStack`, `undoStatesStack` and `currState`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `StatefulResiReg#save()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current ResiReg state in its state history.
- `StatefulResiReg#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous ResiReg state from its state history.
- `StatefulResiReg#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone ResiReg state from its state history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, `Model#undoResiReg()` and `Model#redoResiReg()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `StatefulResiReg` will be initialized with the initial ResiReg state.
Both `redoStatesStack` and `undoStatesStack` will be empty, while `currState` will be set to this single ResiReg state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 3` command to delete the 3rd student in the ResiReg. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, causing the current state of the ResiReg before the `delete 3` command executes
to be saved in the `undoStatesStack` and setting `currState` to be the state of the resident regulation after command execution.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Jet â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, causing the
current unmodified state to be saved in the `undoStatesStack` and `currState` to be set to the modified resident regulation state.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> If a command fails its execution, it will not call <code>Model#saveStateResiReg()</code>, so 
both <code>currState</code> and <code>undoStatesStack</code> will not be updated.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoResiReg()`,
which will add the current state `stateAfterAdd` to `redoStatesStack` and set `currState` to the last entry in
`undoStatesStack`, the previous ResiReg state (`stateBeforeAdd`), and restores the ResiReg to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> If the <code>redoStatesStack</code> is empty, then there are no previous ResiReg states to restore. 
The <code>undo</code> command uses <code>Model#canUndoResiReg()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoResiReg()`, which adds the current state to `undoStatesStack` and set `currState` to the last entry in
`redoStatesStack`, the next ResiReg state, and restores the ResiReg to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> If <code>redoStatesStack</code> is empty, then there are no undone ResiReg states to restore. 
The <code>redo</code> command uses <code>Model#canRedoResiReg()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `rooms`. Commands that do not modify the state of ResiReg
(e.g. `alias`, `rooms`, `togglesplit`, etc.) will not call `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, `Model#undoResiReg()` or `Model#redoResiReg()`. Thus, both `redoStatesStack` and `undoStatesStack` remain unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveStateResiReg()`.
As before, the current state `stateBeforeClear` clear will be pushed into `undoStatesStack`. This time `redoStatesStack` is no longer empty. It will be cleared as it no longer make sense to redo the add n/Jet command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command, 
that is not `undo` or `redo`:

![SaveActivityDiagram](images/SaveActivityDiagram.png)

Separately, the following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes
the `undo` command. (The activity diagram for `redo` is largely similar).

![UndoActivityDiagram](images/UndoActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:
##### How undo & redo executes

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ResiReg.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

##### Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stacks for undo and redo, along with
  a reference to current state.

  - Pros: Closer to the command pattern than the alternative below, meaning a change from Alternative 1
    to Alternative 2 in how undo & redo executes will incur less additional work.
  - Cons: 
    - May have performance issues in terms of memory usage due to holding an additional reference and
    managing two data structures.
    - Follows the Separation of Concerns principle, so the management of 
    undoing and redoing can be viewed separately for easier understanding.

- **Alternative 2:** Use a list to store the state history.
  - Pros: Better performance in terms of memory usage as compared to Alternative 1 and
    has a simpler implementation.
  - Cons: 
    - Further away from the command pattern than Alternative 1, so shifting to Alternative 2
    in how undo & redo executes will incur more additional work. 
    - Also, goes against the Separation
    of Concerns principle since the management of both undoing and redoing
    is handled together.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Data archiving for semester
Allocations of a student to a room are valid only for a given semester. This implies that ResiReg should support the archival and creation of multiple semesters, so that the data can be managed and stored in an organized fashion that suits the OHS admin. The `archive` command accomplishes this by allowing the user to achive the current semester's allocations, and advance to a new semester which pre-fills the Student and Room details.

#### Implementation
The archival feature is facilitated by `Semester`. It is a class denoting the current semester the allocations are valid for.

The following diagram shows how ResiReg is implemented with the `archive` feature. A `Semester` object denoting the current Semester is kept in the `ResiReg` class. Upon executing the `archive` command, ResiReg computes the succeeding Semester from the current Semester. A snapshot of the current semester's data (e.g. allocations) is then stored in a folder that denotes that semester. Finally, the current semester in the application is updated, and the allocations are reset for the admin to start afresh.

Given below is an usage scenario and how the archive mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The current semester is initialized from the `semester` field inside`./data/resireg.json`, when `MainApp.java` calls `Storage#readResiReg`.

Step 2. The user executes the `archive` command to archive the current semester's allocations and advance to the next semester. The `archive` command first retrieves the current state of ResiReg via `Model#getResiReg`.

Step 3. The `archive` command then computes the succeeding state from the current state via `ResiReg#getNextSemesterResiReg`. This method computes the succeeding semester from the current semester via `Semester#getNextSemester`, and resets the allocations of students to rooms.

Step 4. The `Storage#archiveResiReg` is then called. This operation saves the current data of the semester inside `./AY{YEAR}S{SEMESTER}/archive.json`, where `{YEAR}` denotes the academic year and `{SEMESTER}` denotes which semester of the academic year. For example, the data of Semester 1 of Year 2020 would be stored inside `./AY2020S1/archive.json`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Step 5. Finally, the fresh semester in ResiReg is then updated in 2 steps:

Step 5.1: Firstly, the application state is updated by calling `Model#setResiReg` with the computed succeeding state in Step 2. 

Step 5.2: Then, `resireg.json` is updated via `Model#saveStateResiReg`.

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of the `archive` operation as described by the 5 steps above.

![Sequence diagram of archive command](./images/ArchiveSemesterSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Separating the archival and semester updating logic**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** keep the `archiveResiReg` method in the `Storage` interface, and computing of next Semester in `Semester`

  - Pros: Adheres to the Single-responsibility Principle. The responsibility of computing the next Semester is kept to `Semester`, and saving to storage kept to `Storage`.
  - Cons: additional methods like `Semester#getNextSemester` have to be implemented to support 

- **Alternative 2:** Compute the next semester directly within the `archiveResiReg` method
  - Pros: violates the Single-responsibility Principle, as `archiveResiReg` now has 2 responsibilities: computing the next semester, and writing the file to storage
  - Cons: Compared to Alternative 1, less intermediate methods to implement.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Help command

The help command allows the user to view the help message for any command in the application based on the command word. The command word refers to the text that the user enters to execute the application eg. `delete-student` for the command to delete a student, `help` for the help command. 

#### Implementation

The help command is implemented in the `HelpCommand` class and facilitated by the `Help` class and `CommandWordEnum`.

`CommandWordEnum` is an enumeration class where each enumeration object stores the command word, `Help` object and `Parser` associated with a command.

`HelpCommand` uses `CommandWordEnum` to generate a mapping of each command word to its `Help` object, which is stored in a static variable, the `commandWordToHelp` map.

The steps below describes how the help command works:

1. The user enters a command in the format `help <input>`
1. `LogicManager` calls the appropriate classes, as described under the implementation of the `logic` component, to create an instance of `HelpCommand` with the given `input`.
1. `HelpCommand` obtains a list of the current aliases currently registered using `Model#getCommandWordAliases`. This list of aliases is transformed into a map mapping the alias to the command word using `AliasUtils#makeAliasToCommandWordMap`
1. `HelpCommand` uses the alias map to check if the input is an alias, and if it is, maps it to its proper command word.
1. `HelpCommand` checks if the input is blank. If it is, a general help message describing all the commands is shown to the user. This general help message is generated using the `commandWordToHelp` map.
1. Otherwise, `HelpCommand` checks if the input is a valid command word. If it is, the command retrieves the `Help` object for the command from the `commandWordToHelp` map and returns a message describing usage of the command using `Help#getFullMessage`.
1. Otherwise, this means that the input is a non-empty string which is not a valid command word, so an error message informing the user that there is no such command is shown.

The sequence diagram below summarizes these steps. Self calls have been omitted for clarity:

![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: where to store the mapping of command words to Help

Having started with [AddressBook 3's implementation](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java) of the `AddressBookParser` (renamed `ResiRegParser` in our project), which stored the mapping from each command word to its respective CommandParser, the requirements of the HelpCommand was a major reason why we chose to shift the mapping into the `CommandWordEnum` instead.

HelpCommand basically requires a mapping of each command to its Help object. To do this, HelpCommand needs to be able to access some kind of list or other data structure of all commands available in the application, with information about the command word and Help object for each command. These are some of the options we considered on where to store this list:

- **Alternative 1:** Within the HelpCommand class, for example as a map of command words to their Help. When adding a new command, developers add another entry to the map.
    - Pros: simple to implement
    - Cons: it is easy for developers to forget to modify the map in the HelpCommand class when adding new commands. This mistake can easily go unnoticed as the command will still if the command word has been correctly associated with its parser.
- **Alternative 2:** Have a data structure inside ResiRegParser which maps each command word to both its Help and Parser. ResiRegParser uses the mapping from command word to Parser, while the mapping from command word to Help is exposed to HelpCommand via a public method or attribute.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    - Pros: ensures that the HelpCommand is always up to date, as developers must bind the command word to both its Help and Parser.
    - Cons: violates the single responsibility principle. ResiRegParser does not need to know about the Help for each command to parse commands.
- **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Have a separate class (`CommandWordEnum`) containing a data structure that maps each command word to its Parser and Help. Developers would modify this class when adding commands. HelpCommand and ResiRegParser can use the `CommandWordEnum` to generate a mapping of each command word to its Parser or Help respectively.
   - Pros: 
       - Similar to alternative 2, this ensures the HelpCommand is always up to date as developers must bind the command word to both its Help and Parser. 
       - Does not violate the single responsibility principle like alternative 2. Both ResiRegParser and HelpCommand only store the information they need. 
   - Cons:
       - `CommandWordEnum` does not check if there are multiple commands with the same command word.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- an OHS admin at a Residential College\* (in NUS)
- has a need to manage a large number of students and rooms (>800)
- dissatisfied with current MS Excel and paper-based workflow
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage students, rooms, and  allocations faster than a typical GUI app.
