## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -activity 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TravelPlannerPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `WanderlustParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a travel plan).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -activity 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -activity 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the travel planner data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<TravelPlan>`, `ObservableList<Activity>`, `ObservableList<Accommodation>`, `ObservableList<Friend>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the travel planner data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Changing Directory

#### Implementation

*Wanderlust*'s Ui supports navigating to different *travel plans* or *wishlist* so that users can view their desired
*travel plan* or *wishlist* easily. Starting up *Wanderlust* will show the default view of a *wishlist* and users
can use the `goto` command to navigate to their desired directory.

`TravelPlannerPanel`, `TravelPlanPanel` and `TravelPlanObjectListPanel` provide the core components for the display of
*Wanderlust*. When we are in the directory of *travelplan* or *wishlist*, `MainWindow` renders all 3 of the above
components. `TravelPlannerPanel` highlights the directory we are currently in, `TravelPlanPanel` displays the `name` of the
directory and if it is a *travelplan*, it will show the `date` of the *travelplan* as well. Lastly, `TravelPlanObjectListPanel`
displays the respective `activity`, `accommodation` and `friend` list in the UI of a particular directory. Do note that
`wishlist` do not contain any `accommodation` or `friend` list. (The UI will not display any list)

Both `TravelPlannerPanel` and `TravelPlanObjectListPanel` make use of JavaFX's `ListView` to display the list of `travelplan`
or `activity`/`accommodation`/`friend` respectively.

`TravelPlannerPanel` utilizes JavaFX's `Label` to display the `name` of the directory.

`TravelPlanObjectListPanel` utilizes `TabPane` and `Tab` to display the different `activity`/`accommodation`/`friend` tabs
respectively.

The class diagram below shows the relevant classes involved:

![GoToUiClassDiagram](images/GoToUiClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Navigating between directories

`MainWindow` and `CommandResult` facilitates the navigation between directories.

Firstly, `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` initializes an `OberservableDirectory` which **listens** to any directory changes.
`MainWindow#executeCommand()` is then called when user enters a `goto` command into the application. `MainWindow#executeCommand()`
initializes all changes to what is displayed by the UI by calling `Logic#execute()` which returns a `CommandResult`.
From `Logic#execute()`, `MainWindow#handleDirectoryChange()` will navigate the current directory to the one input by the user, changing the
UI to view the new directory. From `CommandResult`, the `ResultDisplay` Ui will then output a text specifying which directory
has been navigated to.

The activity diagram below illustrates the flow of execution when the UI decides which directory to view:

![GoToUiActivityDiagram](images/GoToUiActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is a sequence diagram that shows a scenario whereby the UI navigates to a specified `travelplan` in `Wanderlust`:

![GoToUiSequenceDiagram](images/GoToUiSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration:

Aspect: How navigation between directory works

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Initializing an observable directory in Wanderlust.
  - Pros: Main Window will always be listen to any changes in directory, allowing UI to switch fast
  - Cons: More work has to be done to sync up the UI with the model as we have to create an ObservableDirectory class and
  link to the model manager.

- **Alternative 2**: Passing the Directory as a parameter in CommandResult method
  - Pros: Easy to implement since we just have to return a new CommandResult which has an additional parameter of Directory.
  - Cons: Break the abstraction layer as Commands (Logic) should not have to be aware of how the Model is working.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing Information

#### Implementation
The proposed editing mechanism is facilitated by `EditDescriptor`, `Index` and `EditCommand` which extends `Command`.
Editing can be done to travelplan objects such as `Friend`, `Accommodation` and `Activity` or to `TravelPlan`.

`EditCommand` uses `Index` to identify the object to be modified.
`Index` provides standardisation between the components to refer to a specific travel plan object or travelplan within a list.

`EditCommand` uses `EditDescriptor` to create an edited object.
`EditDescriptor` provides method `buildFromSource(source)` to store and access edited fields specified within the user input.

Each object has a specific set of valid fields that can be modified.
- `Activity`: Name, Importance, Cost, DateTime, Location
- `Accommodation`: Name, StartDate, EndDate, Location, Cost
- `Friend`: Name, Passport, Mobile
- `TravelPlan`: Name, StartDate, EndDate

EditCommand must have at least one field that is edited. Any fields that are invalid will throw an error.
Hence, child classes of EditCommand accounts for editing valid types of field. Each of the following classes extends `EditCommand`
- `EditActivityCommand`
- `EditAccommodationCommand`
- `EditFriendCommand`
- `EditTravelPlanCommand`

`EditCommand` accounts for duplicated objects.

`Activity` contain duplicates when two instances have the same name.

`Friend` contain duplicates when two instances have the same passport number.

`Accommodation` contains duplicates when two instances have the same name, startDate and endDate

`TravelPlan` contains duplicates when two instances have the same name
When the editing of an object results in a duplicated edited object within travelplan list or travelplan object list, an error will be thrown.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the class diagram showing relevant classes involved
![EditCommandClassDiagramDiagram](images/EditCommandClassDiagram.png)

#### Editing a TravelPlan or TravelPlanObject
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.
![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is a sequence diagram that shows a scenario whereby the user edits a specified activity in Wanderlust

The TravelPlan Object or TravelPlan by calling `Logic#execute()` which returns a `CommandResult`. From `CommandResult`, the Ui will then
show a message about the successful edited object.

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

* Note: Due to limitation of PlantUML which do not have an `sd reference frame` implementation,
the image below contains further details from the `execute` reference frame from the above sequence diagram.

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceRef.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design Consideration
Aspect: How edit executes

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Editing in the current travelplan directory
  - Pros: Only require the index shown on the UI to identify the travelplan object to be edited
  - Cons: More work has to be done to sync the retrieval of lists of travel plan object that corresponds to the current travelplan directory

- **Alternative 2**: Require the user to switch travel plan object tabs within the travelplan to edit the specified travelplan object
  - Pros: User will not require to specify the type of travelplan object to be edited
  - Cons: Still require user to specify editing of a travelplan object or travelplan

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a TravelPlan or TravelPlanObject

#### Implementation

*Wanderlust*'s Ui allows users to add a `TravelPlan` to the `TravelPlanner`, an `Activity` to the `Wishlist` and a `TravelPlanObject`
to the `TravelPlan` in the current directory.

`MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called when the user enters a `add` command into the application. `MainWindow#executeCommand()`
adds the TravelPlan/TravelPlanObject by calling `Logic#execute()` which returns a `CommandResult`. `Logic#execute()` also sets the
the `Directory` of the `ObservableDirectory` to the updated `Directory` after adding the TravelPlan/TravelPlanObject so the Ui displays
the updated list of `TravelPlan`s/`TravelPlanObject`s. From `CommandResult`, the `ResultDisplay` Ui will then output a text confirming
to the user that the command was successfully executed.

The activity diagram below shows a scenario whereby a user adds inputs an add command:

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below shows a scenario whereby a user adds an `Activity` to the `TravelPlan`/`Wishlist` in the current directory:

![AddActivitySequenceDiagram](images/AddActivitySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration:

Aspect: How to add `TravelPlanObject`s to the `TravelPlan` in the current `Directory`

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Use individual add commands for each sub-class of `TravelPlanObject`.
  - Pros: Greater abstraction and a more logical implementation since there is a command for each sub-class.
  - Cons: Greater repetition of code.

- **Alternative 2**: Using a `AddTravelPlanObjectCommand` class.
  - Pros: Lesser repetition of code.
  - Cons: Lesser abstraction.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a TravelPlan or TravelPlanObject

#### Implementation

*Wanderlust*'s Ui allows users to delete a `TravelPlan` from the `TravelPlanner`, an `Activity` from the `Wishlist` and a `TravelPlanObject`
from the `TravelPlan` in the current directory.

`MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called when the user enters a `delete` command into the application. `MainWindow#executeCommand()`
deletes the TravelPlan/TravelPlanObject by calling `Logic#execute()` which returns a `CommandResult`. `Logic#execute()` also sets the
the `Directory` of the `ObservableDirectory` to the updated `Directory` after deleting the TravelPlan/TravelPlanObject so the Ui displays
the updated list of `TravelPlan`s/`TravelPlanObject`s. From `CommandResult`, the `ResultDisplay` Ui will then output a text confirming
to the user that the `delete` command was successfully executed.

The activity diagram below shows a scenario whereby a user inputs the `delete` command:

![DeleteActivityDiagram](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram of the `delete` command has been shown above under the [Logic Component](#logic-component) of the developer guide.

#### Design Consideration:

Aspect: How to delete a `TravelPlanObject` from the `TravelPlan` in the current `Directory`

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Use individual delete commands for each sub-class of `TravelPlanObject`.
    - Pros: Greater abstraction and a more logical implementation since there is a command for each sub-class.
    - Cons: Greater repetition of code.

- **Alternative 2**: Using a `DeleteTravelPlanObjectCommand` class.
    - Pros: Lesser repetition of code.
    - Cons: Lesser abstraction and the logic will be reliant on one class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Copy feature

#### Implementation
The copy mechanism supports copying an `activity` from `Wishlist` to a specific `TravelPlan`. It is facilitated by the
add mechanism, except activities can be added to **any** `TravelPlan`  in the `TravelPlanner`, referenced by their index
*(travel plan index)*. The copy mechanism adds a **deep copy** of the activity in `Wishlist` to the specified `TravelPlan`,
not the same instance. Thus, if any activity was edited in one directory, it should not affect all other copies.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The copy command can only be called when
the current directory is the wishlist. Hence, index used to reference activities *(activity index)* refers to that in
the `filteredWishlist` in `Model`. This means, even if the `find` command is used to filter the activities in the
wishlist, the indexes in the `filteredWishlist` will be updated accordingly (and so will the Ui). Hence, as long as the
user uses the index as displayed in the Ui, the correct activity will be referenced.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the copy operation works:

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CopyCommandParser` and
`CopyCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of
diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The indexes used by CopyCommand in the `execute()` method (after parsing) is zero-based.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `copy` command:

![CopyActivityDiagram](images/CopyActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

Aspect: How to duplicate activity *(deep/shallow copy)*
- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Using a deep copy.
    - Pros: More flexibility to have different variations of the activity in different directories (e.g. different dates/times, etc).
    - Cons: Each instance is not synced with the rest. Users have to update each copy separately if they wish to do so.
    *However, there is flexibility to extend other commands (e.g. Edit command) to update all deep copies of the same activity.*
- **Alternative 2**: Using a shallow copy.
    - Pros: Only one instance of each activity means users can update all copies of the activity at once.
    - Cons: Less flexibility to change a copied activity without affecting other copies.
- **Alternative 3**: Have variations of the copy command to allow both deep/shallow copy.
    - Pros: Best of both worlds. Allows for flexibility and convenience at the same time.
    - Cons: Harder to implement. Users need a way to differentiate deep/shallow copies to avoid unintentionally editing
    a shallow copy. Potentially more edge cases to think about and handle.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Move Feature

#### Implementation

The move mechanism makes use of both the copy and delete mechanism.

### Find Feature

#### Implementation

Current implementation of Find feature is facilitated by `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` which implements
`Predicate<Nameable>` and has the **test** method overriden with a custom implementations.

The `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Nameable)` is as follows:
* loops through the **keywords** (of type `List<String>`) and return true if there is any match with the `Nameable`

`Nameable` provides the following operation:
* `Nameable#getName()` - Return the name attribute of a `TravelPlanObject`

`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be passed to `Model#updateFilteredXYZList(Predicate)`
(`updateFilteredActivityList`, etc.). The filtered list will then be updated according to the given `Predicate` and
automatically reflected on the Ui.

The class diagram shows the relevant classes involved:

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

      Expected: Invalid command call at `travelplan` directory. `Copy` can only be called in `wishlist` directory. Error details shown in the status message.

   e. Other incorrect copy commands to try: `move`, `move x`, `move y`<br>
      Expected: Error message is thrown.

### Clear

1. Clear the entire data in wanderlust and returns an empty travel planner.

    a. Test case: `clear`<br>
       Expected: Returns an empty travel planner. Existing data is wiped.

## *Appendix: Effort*

### Model
The `Model` of _wanderlust_ is much more complex than AB3. In AB3, the model is only in charge of the Person class, which takes in simple attributes
relating to Person objects.

In _wanderlust_, each travel plan handles a total of 3 different objects, namely, Activity, Accommodation and Friend. Furthermore,
_wanderlust_ also have an exclusive wishlist that keep track of Activity objects. Essentially, it is similar to one large model
handling 3 x AB3. Complex attributes such as `Cost` is also implemented so that _wanderlust_ can calculate the total cost of the `travelplan`.
Furthermore, the attributes of the different classes have to interact with one another to ensure that they are cohesive.
For instance, we have to make sure any `activty`/`accommodation` date is within the range of the `travelplan`'s date. The logic behind can be
implemented in many ways and we went through a variety of approaches to simplify the logic.

Lastly, the `Model` of _wanderlust_ support higher level features and commands such as sorting, moving and navigating to
different directories that were not present in AB3.

### Logic
The complexity of `Logic` was more advanced than AB3. _wanderlust_'s `Logic` supports
many more commands compared to AB3, such as `sort`, `goto`, `copy`, `move`, `show` commands. Existing commands from AB3 were also
enhanced to handle the complex `Model` of _wanderlust_.

There was significant effort placed in creating the logic for _wanderlust. The `Logic` of _wanderlust is responsible for
at least 3x the `Logic` of AB3. It has to account for the logic of `travelplan`, `wishlist`, `activity`, `accommodation` and `friend` whilst
AB3 handles `Person`. Furthermore, additional logic was implemented to account for the navigation of directories and travel plans.
For example, `ObservableDirectory` class was created to keep track of what directory the user is currently on so that the `Ui` will be
able to display the correct `travelplan` or `wishlist`.

Additional efforts were also put into validating user input and ensuring that _wanderlust_'s parser can handle unexpected input smoothly.

### Storage
The `Storage` was extended to store more classes of _wanderlust_. `activity`, `accommodation`, and `friend` objects have to be organised and
stored in a `travelplan`, and all these data will be placed in a JSON file in an organised manner. Essentially, the JSON file will contain
data of various `travelplan`s and a `wishlist`, and each `travelplan` will contain more data regarding `activity`, `accommodation`, and `friend`,
with each `travelplan` object storing its own attributes as well.

Furthermore, complex attributes such as `wanderlustdate` and `wanderlustdatetime` have to be stored in the JSON file in an approriate format.
Significant time and effort were put into discussing and planning the best way to represent each new attribute in the JSON file.

### Ui
The `Ui` component took us the most amount of time. We have to redesign the entire AB3 Ui to fit _wanderlust_ design.
A lot of effort was placed in planning the structure of the `Ui` so that our user interface will be user-friendly and appealing.
Furthermore, additional logic of navigating between travel plans and switching between the activity/accommodation/friend tabs was implemented
so that users can use the application smoothly. The logic of handling 3 different objects as opposed to just 1 in AB3
turned out to be far more complex than imagined, and we had to do multiple rounds of experimenting and refactoring to
work within certain constraints of JavaFX. One example is that JavaFX's ListView does not accept wildcard-types, thus we
could not simply use `? extends TravelPlanObject` in the `TravelPlanObjectPanel`. This led us to ultimately make use of tab panes
to handle the 3 TravelPlanObject types differently. We also spent a considerable amount of time in studying javafxml and css so that we are able to implement an
entirely new UI with icons and navigation options, making it a more interactive experience for the users as compared to the single page view of AB3's Ui.

### Overall
All in all, this project was a challenging one for the _wanderlust_ team. We started off with many ideas and features that were seemed
very appealing. However, we eventually decided that they were not suitable due to time constraints. In the first iteration, time and effort were placed
in brainstorming and coming up with a concrete and feasible product. Throughout the weeks, we made consistent efforts to study the source code, modify existing features and
create new features for _wanderlust_. There were high standards placed amongst us in ensuring that all of us put in time and effort in building _wanderlust_.
Rigorous testing, trial and error were fundamental in the process so that we can deliver _wanderlust_ within the timeline. Whilst _wanderlust_ may not be
the perfect travel planner application, this journey was a memorable one filled with teamwork and perseverance, and we are all proud of the end product.
