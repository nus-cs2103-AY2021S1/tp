## 1. Introduction

This developer guide provides an overview and details of the system architecture and implementation of **ATAS**.
Its purpose is to provide a useful reference for other developers who wish to contribute to the ongoing project of **ATAS**,
or to simply gain a deeper insight into [the team's](AboutUs.md) development process and considerations.

### 3.1 Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](images/developer-guide/3.1.1-ArchitectureDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.1.1</b>: Architecture Diagram </sub> </p> 

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/developer-guide/3.1.2-LogicClassDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.1.2</b>: Example of class diagram for Logic component </sub> </p> 

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addses s/Tutorial 1 d/10/10/2020`.

![Architecture sequence diagram](images/developer-guide/3.1.3-ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

### 3.2. UI component

![Class Diagram of the UI Component](images/developer-guide/3.2.1-UiClassDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.2.1</b>: Class diagram of the Ui component </sub> </p> 

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooterLeft` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class except `Tab`, which is an enum class.

The `Help Window` contains the `CommandSummary` for each command, so as to display the commands in tables.

Specialised labels like `AttributesLabel` are contained in the `SessionStudentCard` while `StatisticsLabel` are contained in `Studentcard` and `SessionCard`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* displays results to user if any.

### 3.3. Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/developer-guide/3.1.2-LogicClassDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.3.1</b>: Class diagram of the Logic component </sub> </p> 

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AtasParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("enterses 1")` API call.

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the data of the following:
   * student list in a `StudentList` object
   * session list in a `SessionList` object
   * memo in a `Memo` object.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` and `ObservableList<Session>` that can be 'observed'. e.g. For each list, the UI can be bound to the list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/atas/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the student list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the session list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the memo data in txt file and read it back.

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

{ start of `implementation#switch_between_tabs` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 4.1. Switching between different tabs

To allow users to switch between tabs using the CLI, the `switch` command is implemented.

The switching of tabs is facilitated by `SwitchCommand`, `LogicManager`, `MainWindow` and `Tab`. `Tab` is contained in `Ui` and is an enum class that represents the various tabs that exist in **ATAS**.

`SwitchCommand` implements the method:

* `SwitchCommand#execute(Model)` — Returns a `CommandResult` containing the `Tab` to be switched to.

`MainWindow` implements the method:

* `MainWindow#handleSwitchTab()` — Switches the `TabPane` to the specified `Tab`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `switch` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The default `ATAS` tab is displayed.

Step 2. The user executes `switch sessions` command to view the sessions tab. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called and `LogicManager` calls `AtasParser#parseCommand()`. This results in the creation of a `SwitchCommandParser` to parse the user input.

Step 3. `SwitchCommandParser#parse()` checks if there is an argument being passed by the user. If an argument is passed, a `SwitchCommand` will be created and `SwitchCommand#execute()` will be called by the `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If no argument is found, a `ParseException` will be thrown and the execution terminates.

</div><br>

Step 4. `SwitchCommand#execute()` will check if the argument passed in is an existing tab name. If the argument is valid, a `CommandResult` containing a variable `switchTab` with the value of the target `Tab` will be returned to `MainWindow`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the argument is not a valid tab name, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the execution terminates.

</div><br>

Step 5. `MainWindow#handleSwitchTab()` will then be called, which will check if the current `Tab` is the same as the target `Tab` to switched to. If it is not the same, `MainWindow` will utilise `TabPane` to execute the switch, thus updating the screen for the user.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the current `Tab` is the same as the target `Tab`, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the execution terminates.

</div><br>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `switch` operation works:

![SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/4.1.1-SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.1.1</b>: Sequence diagram showing the switching of tabs </sub> </p> 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `switch` command:

![SwitchTabsActivityDiagram](images/developer-guide/4.1.2-SwitchTabsActivityDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.1.2</b>: Activity diagram showing the switching of tabs </sub> </p> 

#### 4.1.1. Design consideration

* `Tab` is being implemented as an enum class because there is a fixed set of tabs that are available to be switched to. This prevents invalid values to be assigned to `Tab`.

{ end of `implementation#switch_between_tabs` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `implementation#user_confirmation` written by: Marcus Tan Wei }

### 4.2. User confirmation

This feature (henceforth referred to as 'user confirmation') is facilitated by `ConfirmCommand`, `DangerousCommand`, `Logic`, `LogicManager`, `Model` and `ModelManager`.

There are 6 DangerousCommand(s) that will change the existing local data upon execution, namely:
1. deletestu (deleting a student)
2. editstu (editing the particulars of a student)
3. clearstu (clearing the student list)
4. deleteses (deleting a sesion)
5. editses (editing the information of a session)
6. clearses (clearing the session list)

`DangerousCommand` implements the method:

* `DangerousCommand#execute(Model)` - Returns a `CommandResult` of the `DangerousCommand`.

`ConfirmationCommand` implements the method:

* `ConfirmationCommand#execute(Model)` - Returns a `CommandResult` containing a user confirmation prompt to confirm the execution of the `DangerousCommand`.

'ConfirmationAcceptCommand' implements the method:

* `ConfirmationAcceptCommand#execute(Model)` - Executes the `DangerousCommand` and returns a `CommandResult` from `DangerousCommand#execute(Model)`.

`ConfirmationRejectCommand` implements the method:

* `ConfirmationRejectCommand#execute(Model)` - Returns a `CommandResult` indicating the `DangerousCommand` is not executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the user confirmation prompt feature behaves at each step.


Step 1. The user launches the application with all his/her students already added to the student list. The `ModelManager` should already contain the list of students assigned to the user.

Step 2. The user executes a dangerous command, for example `deletestu 1`, to delete the first student in the student list. A `DeleteStudentCommandParser` is created by `LogicManager`.
If the input delete command is valid, a `DeleteStudentCommand` will be created by `DeleteStudentCommandParser#parse()` and passed into a `ConfirmationCommand` as a `DangerousCommand`.

Step 3. The `ConfirmationCommand` is executed, and the `ResultDisplay` window shows a confirmation prompt `Delete 1? (yes/no)`, where the user needs to input a `yes` or `no` to confirm or reject the execution of the `DangerousCommand` respectively.

Step 4. If the confirmation input is valid, a `ConfirmationCommandParser` is created by the `LogicManager` and either a `ConfirmationAcceptCommand` or `ConfirmationRejectCommand` is returned by `ConfirmationCommandParser#parser()`.

Step 5. The `ConfirmationAcceptCommand` or `ConfirmationRejectCommand` is then executed in `LogicManager#execute(String)` and a `CommandResult` is returned, which is displayed on `ResultDisplay`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the user confirmation feature works:

![UserConfirmationSequenceDiagram1](images/developer-guide/4.2.1-UserConfirmationSequenceDiagram1.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.2.1</b>: Sequence diagram to show how Logic component works with Model component to provide user confirmation of delete student command </sub> </p>

<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.2.2</b>: Sequence diagram to show how Logic component works with Model component after entering user confirmation </sub> </p>

{ end of `implementation#user_confirmation` written by: Marcus Tan Wei }

{ start of `implementation#adding_a_session` written by: Zhang Sheng Yang }

### 4.3. Adding a session

Adding a session to a class requires user input from the CLI. 
The parser will parse the user input to obtain the name and the date of the session. The newly added
session will also be filled with students' default presence and participation.

The below example given assumes that the user inputs `addses s/Tutorial 1 d/1/1/2020`, which 'Tutorial 1' and
'1/1/2020' are the name and the date of the session to be added, and `addses` command has already been parsed.

Step 1: Parse input and create session

An `AddSessionCommandParser` is created by `LogicManager` and calls `AddSessionCommandParser#parse()` with the given
user input. Input is parsed according to the prefix `s/` and `d/` to identify the parts of the
user input and split it into `String` slices. If both the name and date are present in the input,
those `String` will be used to create a `SessionName` and a `SessionDate` object, which will be used to
create and initialize a `Session` object. The `Session` object created will be the one being added to
the current session list later.

`AddSessionCommandParser#parse()` returns a `AddSessionCommand` object that contains the session object
 back to the `LogicManager`.

![AddSessionSequenceDiagram1](images/developer-guide/4.3.1-AddSessionSequenceDiagram1.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.3.1</b>: Sequence diagram showing the Logic component when adding session command </sub> </p> 

Step 2: Add session to the model/session list

`LogicManager` calls `AddSessionCommand#execute()` to proceed on to adding the session to the model.
The `AddSessionCommand` will first check if the same session is already in the session list, if the
session exists in the current session list, then the session will not be added to the session list.

Assuming that the session to add is not a session already in the list, `ModelManager` will update
the internal student list of the session list, then it uses addSession method to add the session to the
list.

![AddSessionSequenceDiagram2](images/developer-guide/4.3.2-AddSessionSequenceDiagram2.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.3.2</b>: Sequence diagram showing how Logic component works with Model component to add session command</sub> </p> 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `addses` command:

<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.3.3</b>: Activity diagram showing the implementation of add session command </sub> </p> 

{ end of `implementation#adding_a_session` written by: Zhang Sheng Yang }

{ start of `implementation#entering_a_session` written by: Alvin Chee Teck Weng }

### 4.4. Entering a session

This feature (henceforth referred to as 'enter session') is facilitated by `EnterSessionCommand`, `Logic`, `LogicManager`, `Model` and `ModelManager`.

`LogicManager` implements the method:

* `LogicManager#execute(Model)` — Returns a `CommandResult` containing the session index of the session.

`EnterSessionCommand` implements the method:

* `EnterSessionCommand#execute(Model)` — Returns a `CommandResult` containing the session index of the session.

`ModelManager` implements the method:

* `ModelManager#enterSession(Index)` — Enters a session based on session index.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the enter session mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with all his/her students already added to the student list. The `ModelManager` should already contain the list of students assigned to the user.

Step 2. The user executes `enterses 1` to enter session 1. The `enterses 1` command calls `LogicManager#execute()`.

Step 3. `EnterSessionCommandParser#parse()` checks if there argument passed is valid. If the argument is valid, a `EnterSessionCommand` will be created and `EnterSessionCommand#execute()` will be called by the `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If an invalid argument is found, a `ParseException` will be thrown and the execution terminates.
</div><br>

Step 4. `ModelManager#enterSession()` will be called by `EnterSession#execute()` and the displayed tab will be switched to Current Session. Details of session 1 will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the enter session operation works:

![EnterSessionSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/4.4.1-EnterSessionSequenceDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.4.1</b>: Sequence diagram showing how Logic component works with Model component to enter session command</sub> </p>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an enter session command:

![EnterSessionActivityDiagram](images/developer-guide/4.4.2-EnterSessionActivityDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.4.2</b>: Activity diagram showing the implementation of enter session command</sub> </p>

{ end of `implementation#entering_a_session` written by: Alvin Chee Teck Weng }

{ start of `implementation#presence_and_participation` written by: Zhang Sheng Yang }

### 4.5. Presence and participation

Below only shows the flow of `participate` command since `presence` command works the same way.

Toggling the presence and participation status of students requires CLI input.
The parser will parse the user input to obtain an index range in order to toggle students in that range. 
The toggled presence or participation will change in color(either green or red) and statistics will be affected.

The below example given assumes that the user inputs `participate 1-4`, which '1-4' is the index range
, and `participate` command has already been parsed.

Step 1: Parse input

An `ParticipateCommandParser` is created by `LogicManager` and calls `ParticipateCommandParser#parse()` 
with the given user input. Input is parsed according as a preamble to identify the parts of the
user input and split it into `String` slices. If the input index range is valid, checked by validation method in 
`IndexRange` class itself, a `IndexRange` object will be created and initialized with the a default session name as 
a placeholder. The `ParticipateCommand` object created will be passed back to `LogicManager` to execute.

![ParticipateSequenceDiagram1](images/developer-guide/4.5.1-ParticipateSequenceDiagram1.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.5.1</b>: Sequence diagram showing the Logic component for participate command </sub> </p> 

Step 2: Toggling participation

`LogicManager` calls `ParticipateCommand#execute()` to proceed on to toggling the participation status of students in 
the student list in this current session.
The `ParticipateCommand` will first check if we have entered a session, if `model#returnCurrentSessionEnabledStatus()` 
return false, then an exception will be thrown to signal that we are currently not in a session.

Assuming that we are in a session, `ModelManager#updateParticipationBySessionName()` will be called. The session 
name of the current session is obtained and passed as a parameter together with index range during the invocation 
of `SessionList#updateStudentPresence()`. Session list will now search through the list of sessions for a match, 
when a matching session is found, `Session#updatePresence()` is called to toggle the participation status of students 
according to the index range.

{ end of `implementation#presence_and_participation` written by: Zhang Sheng Yang }

{ start of `implementation#random_name_generation` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

### 4.6. Generating the name of a randomly-selected student

This feature (henceforth referred to as 'RNG') is facilitated by `RngCommand` and `RandomGenerator`.

`RngCommand` implements the method:

* `RngCommand#execute(Model)` — Returns a `CommandResult` containing the name of a randomly-selected student.

`RandomGenerator` implements the method:

* `RandomGenerator#getNextInt(int)` — Returns the index of the next randomly-generated student.

The `RandomGenerator` is contained in `Model`. It implements the method:

* `ModelManager#generateRandomStudentIndex()` — Returns the index of a randomly-generated student in the student list.

The operation above is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#generateRandomStudentIndex()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the RNG mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with all his/her students already added to the student list. The `ModelManager` should already contain the list of students assigned to the user.

Step 2. The user executes `rng` to pick a random student in his/her student list. The `rng` command calls `Model#generateRandomStudentIndex()`, which in turn calls `RandomGenerator#getNextInt(int)`.

Step 3. The `Index` returned during the execution of `RngCommand#execute(Model)` is used to fetch the name of the corresponding student (in the student list) to be selected. The student's name is then displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the RNG operation works:

{ end of `implementation#random_name_generation` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

{ start of `implementation#undo_redo` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

### 4.7. Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. 
It contains the following entities:
* `VersionedStudentList`
* `VersionedSessionList`
* `VersionedAttributesList` 

Each versioned entity extends its corresponding non-versioned class (e.g. `VersionedStudentList` extends from `StudentList`)
with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `<<entity>>StateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, each entity implements the following operations:

* `Versioned<<Entity>>List#commit()` — Saves the current entity state in its history.
* `Versioned<<Entity>>List#undo()` — Restores the previous entity state from its history.
* `Versioned<<Entity>>List#redo()` — Restores a previously undone entity state from its history.

The operations above are called in `ModelManager` under their respective methods within the class:
* `ModelManager#commit()`
* `ModelManager#undo()`
* `ModelManager#redo()` 

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** Whenever a command that commits is made, `Model#commit()` is called, which means that
 all 3 of `<<Versioned<<Entity>>List>>#commit()` will be called. 
 A similar mechanism occurs for `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()`. <br>

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. Each `Versioned<<Entity>>` will be initialized with the initial entity state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single entity state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/developer-guide/4.7.1-UndoRedoState0.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.7.1</b>: Each versioned entity state upon initialization </sub> </p> 

Step 2. The user executes `deletestu 5` command to delete the 5th student in the student list. 
The `deletestu` command calls `Model#commit()`, causing the modified state of all versioned entities after the `deletestu 5` command executes to be saved in the `<<entity>>StateList`,
 and the `currentStatePointer` for each `Versioned<<Entity>>List>>` is shifted to the newly inserted entity state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/developer-guide/4.7.2-UndoRedoState1.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.7.2</b>: Each versioned entity state upon executing the `deletestu` command </sub> </p> 

Step 3. The user executes `addstu n/David …​` to add a new student. The `addstu` command also calls `Model#commit()`, causing another modified address entity state (for each state) to be saved into the `<<entity>>StateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/developer-guide/4.7.3-UndoRedoState2.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.7.3</b>: Each versioned entity state upon executing the `addstu` command </sub> </p> 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so any entity state will not be saved into the `<<entity>>StateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` for *all* versioned entities once to the left, pointing it to the previous entity state, and restores each entity to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/developer-guide/4.7.4-UndoRedoState3.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.7.4</b>: Each versioned entity state upon executing a single `undo` command </sub> </p> 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial entity state, then there are no previous entity states to restore. 
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. 
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide/4.7.5-UndoSequenceDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.7.5</b>: Sequence diagram showing how the Logic component works with Model component for the `undo` operation </sub> </p> 

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` for each versioned entity once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores each entity to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `<<entity>>StateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest entity state, then there are no undone entity states to restore. 
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `liststu`. Commands that do not modify any entity, such as `liststu`, will usually not call `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. 
Thus, the `<<entity>>StateList` for each versioned entity remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/developer-guide/4.7.6-UndoRedoState4.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.7.6</b>: Each versioned entity state upon executing the `liststu` command </sub> </p> 

Step 6. The user executes `clearstu`, which calls `Model#commit()`. 
Since the `currentStatePointer` for each versioned entity is not pointing at the end of the `<<entity>>StateList`, all entity states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. 
Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addstu n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

#### 4.7.1. Design consideration

**Aspect: how undo & redo execute**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** For each versioned entity, saves the entire entity.
   * Pros: Easy to implement.
   * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
   * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletestu`, just save the student being deleted).
   * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Aspect: data structure to store the different entity states**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** List
   * Pros: Very straightforward.
   * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of runtime (linear).
   
* **Alternative 2:** Search tree
   * Pros: Much more time-efficient than a list due to logarithmic time complexity for most its functions (search, add, etc.)
   * Harder to implement.

### 4.8. Adding a note

To allow users to add notes into the memo without switching to the `Memo` tab, adding a note is implemented.

Adding a note is facilitated by `AddNoteCommand`, `Memo`, `TxtMemoStorage` and `MemoBox`.

This implementation of this feature can be split into 3 main parts:
1. Updating the content in `Memo`.
2. Updating the data in the hard disk.
3. Updating the content in `MemoBox` to be displayed to the user.

`AddNoteCommand` implements the method:

* `AddNoteCommand#execute()` — Calls `Model#addNoteCommand()` and returns a `CommandResult` which notifies the `Ui` component to edit the content in `MemoBox`.

`Memo` is contained in `Model`. It implements the method:

* `Memo#addNote()` — Appends the note to the current content and sets the new content to be the new content of `Memo`.

`TxtMemoStorage` implements `MemoStorage` which is contained in `Storage`. It implements the method:

* `TxtMemoStorage#saveMemo()` — Writes the content in `Memo` to the hard disk.

`MemoBox` is contained in `Ui`. It implements the method:
* `Memo#setTextContent()` — Sets text into a text box contained on `MemoBox` to be displayed to the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `addnote` behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addnote note` to add the word "note" onto a new line in the memo box.

Step 2. An `AddNoteCommand` is created, and the `AddNoteCommand#execute()` is called by the `LogicManager`. 

Step 3. `AddNoteCommand#execute()` will then call `Model#addNoteToMemo()` to update the content in `Memo`.

Step 4. `ModelManager#addNoteToMemo()` calls `Memo#addNote()` which concatenates "note" to the end of the original content and sets it to be the new content of `Memo`.

The following sequence diagram shows how adding a note updates the content in `Memo`:

![AddNoteSequenceDiagram1](images/developer-guide/4.8.1-AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.8.1</b>: Sequence diagram showing how the content in `Memo` is updated</sub> </p> 

Step 5: After the content in `Memo` is updated, `Storage#saveMemo()` is called by the `LogicManager`.

Step 6: `StorageManager#saveMemo()` calls `TxtMemoStorage#saveMemo()` which retrieves the updated content in `Memo` and writes in to a hard disk, following a specified file path.

The following sequence diagram shows how adding a note updates the data in the hard disk:

![AddNoteSequenceDiagram2](images/developer-guide/4.8.2-AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png) 
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.8.2</b>: Sequence diagram showing how the memo content in the hard disk is updated </sub> </p> 

Step 7: A `CommandResult` containing a variable `isEditMemo` with the value `True`, returned from `AddNoteCommand#execute()` is returned to `MainWindow#executeCommand()`. This results in `MainWindow#handleEditMemo()` being called.

Step 8: `MainWindow#handleEditMemo()` retrieves the updated `Memo` content using `LogicManager#getMemoContent()` and calls `MemoBox#setTextContent()` to set the updated content into the text box contained in `MemoBox`.

The following sequence diagram shows how adding a note updates the text box of `MemoBox` to be displayed to the user:

![AddNoteSequenceDiagram3](images/developer-guide/4.8.3-AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png) 
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.8.3</b>: Sequence diagram showing how the `MemoBox` content is updated </sub> </p>

### 4.9. [Proposed] Exporting data to csv

A data exporting feature to csv can be implemented in the future.

Pros: Data are now more organised can be opened by apps such as Microsoft Excel.

Cons: Not easy to implement because it requires the knowledge of how to organise the data into csv format.

{ start of `implementation#data_encryption` written by: Marcus Tan Wei }

### 4.10 [Proposed] Data encryption
Data encryption can be implemented in the future versions. This is to further protect the students' particulars. 

#### 4.10.1 Solution 1
Encrypt and store data locally.

* Pros: 
   * Easy to implement. One example is through the usage of Java Cryptography API.

* Cons: 
   * Performance reduction may occur since every call to save to storage requires encrypting a lot of data.
   * Security issues may still arise if we store the encryption key in the same machine.

#### 4.10.2 Solution 2
Store data outside the user’s machine and issue the user an access token.

* Pros: 
   * Data will be bounded to multiple machines, hence, can be restored if the user forgets his or her credentials.

* Cons: 
   * There will be generation of access tokens and checking them.
   * Require changes to the current implementation to work with external storage.

## 12. Appendix: effort

**Difficulty level:**

The overall difficulty level of the project was relatively high. 
For most of our team, this was our first significant foray into the world of software engineering, and specifically
our first time working in a group to develop a medium-sized application.

**Challenges faced:**

* It was our first time working on a brown-field project, so a few weeks were needed just to get used to the existing codebase.
* It was also our first time dealing with some of the libraries and frameworks used in this project (like Jackson), 
  so a bit of time was needed to be familiar with them.
* (in the beginning especially) We faced issues regarding project management (specifically role delegation), and
  we had troubles with resolving merge conflicts and meeting deadlines in our first iteration.
* With each new iteration, we would sometimes face regression issues, as some new features would cause older ones to be buggy. 
* AB3 only dealt with a single entity type, but for **ATAS**, we had to deal with multiple entity types (students, 
  sessions, attributes) which had their own specific set of complications and subtle differences in implementations.  
* Significant time had to be spent on fixing and refining the following features: 
   * "current session": This was an integration feature done during an early iteration when we were still relatively unfamiliar with the codebase.
   * "undo/redo": This was a feature that was hard to get right because of the different entity types being slightly different in nature.
     ("students" were a "one-layer" entity while each "session" had their own list of "attributes", making it a "two-layer" entity)

**Effort required:**

* Weekly meetings were held (about 2 hours every Wednesday) to review what had been done in the week prior, as well as 
  discuss future tasks for the next week.
* Our team worked tirelessly week in and week out for several (~7) weeks, sparing no effort during each iteration 
  (on both new implementations as well as making sure the older ones aren't buggy).
* We emphasized on communication being key and ensured the following:
   * No PR (made by one teammate) would be merged unless explicitly reviewed and approved by another teammate.
   * Queries, no matter how small, would be answered promptly in our shared Telegram group channel.
   * Each meeting was productive and preparations were made prior to each in the form of a meeting agenda.
   * Conflicts were resolved amicably. 

**Achievements:**

* Overall, we managed to develop a product that we could be proud of.
* Each team member was absolutely vital to the success of the completion of **ATAS**. Everyone had a distinct role to play
  and was more than willing to help one another out with their respective tasks.
* Our team has learned a lot throughout the development of **ATAS**. 
  We have become significantly more adept to handling the different aspects of software engineering, including (but not limited to):
   * General programming competencies (especially in Java) (adhering to code style, improved OOP skills, etc.)
   * Project management (meeting deadlines and deliverables)
   * Good documentation writing (user guide, developer guide, etc.)
   * Conflict resolution
* This project has only made us hungrier and ready to overcome more challenges in the realm of software development in the future.
