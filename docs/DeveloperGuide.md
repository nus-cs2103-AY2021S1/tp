## Introduction

GradPad is an offline computer application meant to help Computer Science students from the
National University of Singapore (NUS) plan their modules with more ease. All module information is
displayed through our simple and organised Graphical User Interface (GUI). GradPad is also optimised 
for users who prefer working on a Command Line Interface (CLI).

The objectives of the application include:

1. Allowing NUS CS students to track their degree progress.
2. Allowing NUS CS students to plan their modules for upcoming semesters.
3. Providing a fast and convenient way to view NUS CS module details.

## About this Guide

This is a Developer Guide written for developers who wish to contribute to or extend
our GradPad Project. The guide will explain the different components that make up GradPad
and how these components come together to implement GradPad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`Nusmods`**](#nusmods-component): Reads data from the NUSMODS public API.

Each of the first four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `GradPadParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the GradPad data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the GradPad data in json format and read it back.
* stores required modules that are on the Computer Science curriculum, in the `RequiredCommandStorage` class.
* stores all General Education modules available in NUS, in the `GemCommandStorage` class.

### Design considerations

We chose to set up the module-specific Storage classes, with the sole purpose of extracting and parsing the JSON data
so that GradPad can interact with it.

### Rationale

This is done so that the `RequiredCommand`, `GemCommand` and `ScienceCommand` classes do not have to worry about
data retrieval and storage, such that they can focus on executing the command logic.

The two Storage classes are separated to avoid cluttering up `RequiredCommandStorage`, due to the hefty size of
General Education Modules.

### Nusmods component

![Structure of the Nusmods Component](images/NusmodsClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`NusmodsData.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/nusmods/NusmodsData.java)

The `Nusmods` component,
* can fetch module data from the NUSMODS public API.
* can save fetched module data in the form of `ModuleInfo` objects to a local JSON file.
* can provide module information based on a module code, in the form of `ModuleInfo` objects.

Critically, the component is able to fall back on reading pre-fetched module information from a local file when 
there's no internet connection.

#### Design considerations

We chose to split the `Nusmods` component into two main parts that have the following responsibilities respectively:
* Fetch module data - handled by `DataFetcher`
* Allow other GradPad components to access module data - handled by `NusmodsData`

##### Rationale

We chose to do this instead of clumping all the logic together to achieve better encapsulation and abstraction.
With this, the `NusmodsData` class only needs to be concerned with reading available module data, processing it,
and serving it up to the code who requested it. It doesn't need to care about how the data got there. 
That's the job of the `DataFetcher` class. As such, it is easy for us to swap out `DataFetcher`, or change its 
implementation without the need to touch the public interface provided by `NusmodsData`. This will prove to be 
useful when, for example, the NUSMODS API becomes obsolete, and we need to use another API, or if the NUSMODS 
API changes, and we need to redesign how we fetch data from it.


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Nusmods feature
GradPad is tightly integrated with the NUSMods public API by using it to retrieve NUS module information to display
to users. More specifically, GradPad can perform the following operations:

* Retrieve information about a single module via the `/modules` API endpoint
* Retrieve a list of all NUS modules via the `/moduleList` API endpoint
* Store retrieved module information data from the aforementioned endpoints as local JSON files
* Read pre-fetched module information from local JSON files

The last 2 operations are crucial to allow GradPad to operate even without an internet connection. This will
be elaborated further below.

#### How a single module's data is retrieved (when connected to the internet)
GradPad uses the `ModuleInfo` class to represent module information received from NUSMods. Besides storing the various
schema fields in the API's JSON response as plain old Java objects (POJOs), it also handles the massaging of these
fields when they are read. 
For e.g. the raw numerical semesters "3" and "4" must be mapped to "Special Term I" and "Special Term II" when read.

This is the flow of logic when a single module's data is fetched via the API:

1. Some client code calls the `getModuleInfo` method in the `NusmodsDataManager` class and passes in a 
module code as a string parameter.

2. `getModuleInfo` calls the `fetchModuleInfo` method in the `DataFetcherManager` class.

3. `fetchModuleInfo` then makes a HTTP GET request to the NUSMods `/modules` endpoint via the `makeGETRequest`
utility method defined within the `HttpUtil` class. It also specifies the module code of the module it wants to fetch.

4. The `makeGETRequest` method returns the HTTP response as a string. In this case, the response returned is a 
JSON string. 

5. `fetchModuleInfo` then parses this JSON string into a `ModuleInfo` object.

Note: GradPad sets a 3s second timeout for all HTTP GET requests made. Adjust this where necessary.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this flow:

![NusmodsFetchModuleSequenceDiagram](images/NusmodsFetchModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### How a single module's data is retrieved (when disconnected from the internet)
Without an internet connection, GradPad clearly cannot retrieve module information via HTTP requests. Instead,
GradPad provides a fallback by including pre-fetched CS curriculum modules in each app release. This is a compromise
we choose to take. While pre-fetched data implies that it might not be up-to-date, we feel that this is better than
completely disallowing users from using GradPad without an internet connection. On top of this, we only choose
to pre-fetch CS curriculum modules as scraping and saving all 5800+ NUS modules means we'll have to make ungraceful
API requests and bloat our releases. It is also not scalable in any way.

This is the flow of logic when a single module's data is retrieved without an internet collection:

1. Some client code calls the `getModuleInfo` method in the `NusmodsDataManager` class and passes in a 
module code as a string parameter.

2. `getModuleInfo` calls the `fetchModuleInfo` method in the `DataFetcherManager` class. However, as there is no
 internet connection, this method call will fail with an exception.

3. Catching this, `getModuleInfo` proceeds to call the `getModuleInfoFromFile` method within the same class instead.

4. `getModuleInfoFromFile` then retrieves the local JSON file containing the module's information, reads it, and
parses it into a `ModuleInfo` object.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this flow:

![NusmodsFetchLocalModuleSequenceDiagram](images/NusmodsFetchLocalModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### How module data is scraped and saved locally
As explained in the previous section, GradPad is able to access pre-fetched module information stored as local
JSON files. This section will explain the script used to scrape and save the 100+ CS curriculum modules that runs 
before shipping out GradPad releases.

This is the script's flow of logic:
1. The entry point of this flow is the `fetchAndSaveModules` method within the `DataFetcherManager` class. 

2. `fetchAndSaveModules` starts by fetching a list of all modules from the `/moduleList` API endpoint via a call
to the `fetchModuleSummaryList` method.

3. `fetchModuleSummaryList` makes the HTTP GET request and parses the JSON string response into a list of
 `ModuleSummary`
objects. 

4. This list of `ModuleSummary` objects are then filtered to remove all non-CS curriculum modules by passing it through
the `filterModuleSummaries` method.

5. Now that this list only contains `ModuleSummary` objects related to the CS curriculum, it is then passed to the
`generateModuleInfoMap` method.

6. `generateModuleInfoMap`'s main job is to create a map of module codes to `ModuleInfo` objects so that GradPad can 
easily retrieve `ModuleInfo` objects given a module code. It does this by 
iterating through every `ModuleSummary`, and fetching that module's module information from the `/modules` endpoint.
It then parses each module's information into a `ModuleInfo` object and puts it in a hashmap.

7. After this map is populated, it is then serialized and saved into a local JSON file.

Note: GradPad rate-limits step 6 with a 100ms delay between successive hits to the `/modules` endpoint. Adjust where
necessary.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this flow:

![NusmodsScrapeModuleSequenceDiagram](images/NusmodsScrapeModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

### Command Stalling feature

GradPad stalls certain commands that erase data so that users can provide confirmation as to
whether or not they wish to proceed with the commands. This feature relies heavily on each commands' `requiresStall()` method.

This is the general flow of logic when handling commands:

![StalledActivityDiagram](images/StalledActivityDiagram.png)


1. If a command `requiresStall`, `LogicManager` will self-invoke its `handleStall()` to store the command to be stalled.

2. `handleStall()` will then return a `CommandResult` which prompts the user for a confirmation.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this flow:

![StalledSequenceDiagram](images/StalledSequenceDiagram.png)

If the user provides a `YesCommand`, the `stalledCommand` is executed.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this flow:

![ConfirmStalledSequenceDiagram](images/ConfirmStalledSequenceDiagram.png)

However, if the user does not provide a `YesCommand`, the stalledCommand will be set to null, after which an abort message will be displayed.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this flow:

![CancelStalledSequenceDiagram](images/CancelStalledSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add feature
GradPad allows users to add modules to their list.

The following fields of a module are required (* for optional):
* Module Code
* Tags*

As with all operations in GradPad, the `AddCommand` class handles the execution of add operations.
The `AddCommandParser` class helps to parse user's input before creating the correct add command.

Given below is how an add operation behaves at each step of its execution.

1. The user types in a command string corresponding to an add operation.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class. The user input is passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand` method of the `gradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `gradPadParser.parseCommand()` sees that this is an add command, and so uses the `AddCommandParser` class to create a corresponding `AddCommand`, using the `AddCommandParser.parse()` method.

5. In `AddCommandParser.parse()`, the string input is first split into tokens, i.e. module code, tags, etc.

6. The `ModuleInfoSearcher.searchModule()` is then called to retrieve module information (module title, modular credits, etc.) from Nusmods.

7. Once the module information is retrieved, a new `Module` object is created from the module information and tags. It now stores the values that we want to add into our list.

8. Lastly, in the same method call, an `AddCommand` is created with the new populated `Module`, and is passed back to the `LogicManager` in step 2.

9. `Logic Manager` executes the newly created `AddCommand`.

10. Finally, the `Model` is then updated by adding the new `Module` object.

**Auto-Retrieval of Module Information**

GradPad's `add` feature supports auto retrieval of module information from NUSMods, mainly a module's title and modular credits.
This is to ensure that the modules added into GradPad are valid NUS modules, and the module information for each module is accurate.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command is executed.

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit feature
GradPad allows users to edit modules that have already been added. 

The following fields of a module can be edited:
* Module Code
* Tags

As with all operations in GradPad, the `EditCommand` class handles the execution of edit operations.
The `EditCommandParser` class helps to parse a user's input before creating the correct edit command.

GradPad uses the `EditModuleDescriptor` class to facilitate edit operations. An `EditModuleDescriptor` is
a temporary bridge that holds the newly-edited fields of a module. You can set the `ModuleCode` and `Tags` of an `EditModuleDescriptor`,
whereas the `ModuleTitle` and `ModularCredits` of a module will be retrieved automatically via NUSMods. 
At least one field (`ModuleCode` or `Tags`) must be specified to successfully edit a module.

Given below is how an edit operation behaves at each step of its execution.

1. The user types in a command string corresponding to an edit operation.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class. The user input is passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `gradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `gradPadParser.parseCommand()` sees that this is an edit command, and so uses the `EditCommandParser`
class to create a corresponding `EditCommand`.

5. In `EditCommandParser`, the string input is first split into tokens, i.e. new module code, new tags, etc.

6. The `ModuleInfoSearcher.searchModule()` is then called to retrieve module information (module title, modular credits, etc.) of the new module from Nusmods.

7. Once the module information is retrieved, an `EditModuleDescriptor` object is created from the module information and tags. It now stores
the new values that we want to update the target module with.

8. An `EditCommand` is then created with this populated `EditModuleDescriptor`, and is passed back to the
`LogicManager` in step 2.

9. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `EditCommand`.

10. The target module to be edited is retrieved. A copy of it is made and using the populated
 `EditModuleDescriptor`, the fields that are to be updated are replaced with their new values.
 
11. The `Model` is then updated by replacing the target module with its new updated copy.

**Auto-Retrieval of Module Information**

When a user wishes to edit the module code of a module, GradPad's `edit` feature supports auto retrieval of the new module information from NUSMods, mainly the module's title and modular credits.
This is to ensure that newly edited modules are valid NUS modules, and the module information for the edited module is accurate.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit command is executed.

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete feature
GradPad allows users to delete modules that have already been added. 

As with all operations in GradPad, the `DeleteCommand` class handles the execution of delete operations.
The `DeleteCommandParser` class helps to parse a user's input before creating the correct delete command.

Given below is how a delete operation behaves at each step of its execution.

1. The user types in a command string corresponding to a delete operation.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class. The user input is passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `gradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `gradPadParser.parseCommand()` sees that this is an delete command, and so uses the `DeleteCommandParser`
class to create a corresponding `DeleteCommand`, using the `DeleteCommandParser.parse()` method.

5. In `DeleteCommandParser`, the ModuleCode is first extracted from the string input. 

6. A `DeleteCommand` is then created with the ModuleCode, and is passed back to the
`LogicManager` in step 2.

7. `LogicManager` self-invokes its `handleStall()` method and returns a `CommandResult` which prompts the user for a confirmation.

8. When the user enters a `YesCommand`, `LogicManager` executes the stalled `DeleteCommand`.

9. The target module to be deleted is retrieved, if it exists in the Completed Modules of GradPad. 
 
10. The `Model` is then updated by removing the target module.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command is executed.

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the user performs a Force Delete Operation, 
the `LogicManager` will skip the part where it self-invokes its `handleStall()` method, and execute the command immediately.

</div>

### Find feature
GradPad allows users to find a specific module or a group of modules with common tags or sequence of characters. This feature is especially useful 
if there is a long list of modules currently in GradPad and users want to avoid the hassle of scrolling through the 
entire list to look for specific module(s). 

As with all operations in GradPad, the `FindCommand` class handles the execution of find operations.
The `FindCommandParser` class helps to parse a user's input before creating the correct find command.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a find operation behaves during its execution.

1. The user types in a command string corresponding to a find operation, e.g. "find cs foundation".

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class. The user input is passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `GradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `GradPadParser.parseCommand()` identifies the command as a find command, and thus uses the `FindCommandParser`
class to extract the string input as a list of keywords and create a `CompoundFindPredicate` with said list.

5. `CompoundFindPredicate` will test every keyword in the list against the logical union of both predicates 
`ModuleCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `ModuleContainsTagsPredicate`, and returns the result.

6. A corresponding `FindCommand` will then be created using this `CompoundFindPredicate`.

5. This `FindCommand` is then passed back to the`LogicManager` in step 2.

6. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `FindCommand`.

7. `FindCommand.execute()` calls for `Model` to filter the GradPad list based on the given predicate(s).

8. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and returned to show the result of the execution.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the find command is executed.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

### List feature

The `list` command shows all modules that have been added by the user in the `Completed Modules` list.
This is needed as certain commands can change the modules that are being displayed. One such command is the
`find` command, which shows only matching modules in the list.

Before diving into how the `list` operation is executed, we must first gain a brief understanding of how the 
`Completed Modules` list displays its modules, and how this display can be changed by other commands.

The `Completed Modules` list is implemented by the `ModuleListPanel` UI class.
This class contains a list of modules, which comes from GradPad's `Model` component, that it uses to 
display to the user. To change the contents of the list, commands can apply filters to this list through `Model`.
For example, a command may ask `Model` to only show modules that have 4 modular credits.
When this happens, `Completed Modules` naturally changes the modules it displays too.

The following diagram illustrates this relationship:

![ModelFilteredListDiagram](images/ModelFilteredListClassDiagram.png)

With this in mind, the aim of the `list` command is therefore to remove any existing filter on this module list,
effectively getting `Completed Modules` to display all modules once again.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a list operation behaves during its execution to achieve just this.

1. The user input is parsed and constructs a `ListCommand` object. (Implementation details of the parser are omitted
 here as they are not central in developing an understanding of the `list` operation)

2. When this command is executed, it calls the `updateFilteredModuleList` method in the `Model` class and passes in
a predicate that lets all modules through the filter.

3. The `Model` class updates its `filteredModules` list to include all modules as if it were unfiltered.

4. The `ModuleListPanel` UI component listens to changes in `filteredModules` and updates whenever the list is updated.
It thus updates to display all modules too.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the list command is executed.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

### CheckMc feature

The `checkmc` command allows users to view a tally of the total no. of modular credits from the modules present 
in the `Completed Modules` list.

As with all operations in GradPad, the `CheckMcCommand` class handles the execution of `checkmc` operations.
In brief, it works by going through all modules in the `Completed Modules` list and summing up each module's
modular credits.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a `checkmc` operation behaves during its execution.

1. The user enters the `checkmc` command string.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class with the user input passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `GradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `GradPadParser.parseCommand()` identifies the command as a checkmc command and thus creates a `CheckMcCommand`
object.

5. This command object is then passed back to the `LogicManager` in step 2.

6. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `CheckMcCommand`.

7. `CheckMcCommand.execute()` retrieves the `GradPad` object stored within `Model` and accesses the `modules` field
within the `GradPad`.

8. It then loops through `modules`, which is a list of `Module` objects, and sums up all their modular credits.

8. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created to show the total no. of modular credits calculated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `checkmc` command is executed.

![CheckMcDiagram](images/CheckMcSequenceDiagram.png)

### Check required modules feature

The `required` command allows users to view the required modules in the NUS Computer Science curriculum 
that they have yet to take.

When the command is executed, it checks through the current modules in the `Completed Modules` list and ensures
that modules that have already been taken are not displayed in the list of remaining required modules.

This is achieved with the `RequiredCommand` and `RequiredCommandStorage` class. The `RequiredCommandStorage` class
handles the extracting, parsing of JSON module data while the `RequiredCommand` handles the logic
behind filtering the undone modules.

As with all operations in GradPad, the `RequiredCommand` class handles the execution of `required` operations.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a `required` operation behaves during its execution.

1. The user enters the `required` command string.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class with the user input passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `GradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `GradPadParser.parseCommand()` identifies the command as a required command and thus creates a `RequiredCommand`
object.

5. This command object is then passed back to the `LogicManager` in step 2.

6. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `RequiredCommand`, which will contain the following uninitialised attributes,
list of `currentModules` in GradPad, all the `leftOverModules` and a `RequiredCommandStorage` to store all modules
in the syllabus.

7. Then, `RequiredCommand.execute()` retrieves the `GradPad` object stored within `Model` and accesses the `modules
` field within the `GradPad` with a few method calls, before storing it in `currentModules`.

8. `RequiredCommand.execute()` then calls its own method `setStorage` to create a `RequiredCommandStorage` object.

9. Within the `setStorage` method, various method calls are made for each module category (Eg. Foundation, IT Professionalism)
 to set up the `RequiredCommandStorage` object with the all the relevant modules.

10. Then, `RequireCommand.execute()` call its own method `compareAllGEs()` to check if any GE pillars have not been cleared.
It then keeps track of which pillars have not been cleared.

11. `RequireCommand.execute()` then proceeds to call its own methods `compareModules`, `compareScience` and `compareInternship`
to keep track of undone modules by cross-referring to the `currentModules` list.

12. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created with the `leftOverModules` to show the filtered list of remaining required modules.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `required` command is executed.

![RequiredDiagram](images/RequiredSequenceDiagram.png)

### Check all available Science Modules

The `science` command allows users to view all available Science modules available on the Computer Science curriculum.

When the command is executed, a list of all available Science modules will be displayed on the `Result Display`.

This is achieved by tapping into the `RequiredCommandStorage` class to extract and parse the Science modules, while the
`ScienceCommand` class handles the logic of displaying the modules. This command is separated from the `required`
command to avoid cluttering of the `Result Display`. 

As with all operations in GradPad, the `ScienceCommand` class handles the execution of `science` operations.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a `science` operation behaves during its execution.

1. The user enters the `science` command string.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class with the user input passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `GradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `GradPadParser.parseCommand()` identifies the command as a science command and thus creates a `ScienceCommand`
object.

5. This command object is then passed back to the `LogicManager` in step 2.

6. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `ScienceCommand`, which will contain an empty list of `scienceModules`,
to be filled up by fetching a `RequiredCommandStorage` object.

7. Then, the `ScienceCommand.execute()` calls its own method, `setScienceModules()` which creates a
`RequiredCommandStorage` object.

8. Inside the `setScienceModules()` method, the `setRequiredScience` method of the `RequiredCommandStorage` class
is invoked, which sets `scienceModules` with the list of available Science modules.

9. Then, `ScienceCommand.execute()` calls for `Model` to filter out all existing Science modules in GradPad from
`scienceModules`, via the `hasModule()` method.

10. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created with the `filteredScienceModules` to display the modules.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `science` command is executed.

### Check all available General Education Modules

The `gem` command allows users to view all available General Education (GE) modules available in NUS.

When the command is executed, a list of all available GE modules will be displayed on the `Result Display`.

This is achieved with the `GemCommand` and `GemCommandStorage` class. The `GemCommandStorage` class
handles the extracting and parsing of JSON module data while the `GemCommand` handles the logic of displaying the
modules. This command is separated from `required` to avoid cluttering up the `Result Display` due to the hefty
amount of GE modules displayed.

As with all operations in GradPad, the `GemCommand` class handles the execution of `gem` operations.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a `gem` operation behaves during its execution.

1. The user enters the `gem` command string.

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class with the user input passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `GradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `GradPadParser.parseCommand()` identifies the command as a gem command and thus creates a `GemCommand`
object.

5. This command object is then passed back to the `LogicManager` in step 2.

6. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `GemCommand`, which will contain 2  uninitialised
`GemCommandStorage` attributes, used to store Semester 1 and 2 General Education Modules.

7. `GemCommand.execute()` then calls its own method `setSem1Storage` and `setSem2Storage` to create 2 `GemCommandStorage`
objects.

8. Within the `setSem1Storage` and `setSem2Storage` methods, various method calls are made for each GE pillar (Eg. GET, GER)
to set up the `sem1Storage` and `sem2Storage` objects with the all the relevant `sem1GeModules` and `sem2GeModules`.

9. Then, `GemCommand.execute()` calls for `Model` to filter out all existing GE modules in GradPad from both
`sem1GeModules` and `sem2GeModules`, via the `hasModule()` method.

10. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created with all the filtered GE modules, displaying all the available
GE modules by Semester.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `gem` command is executed.

![GemDiagram](images/GemSequenceDiagram.png)

### Search feature

The `search` command allows users to search for any module available in NUS and display the module details.

To retrieve a module's information, the execution of this command interacts with the `Nusmods` component, which
contains all logic related to the access of module data from the NUSMODS public API. We will not go into detail
about the component here as we are mainly focused on the implementation of the search functionality.

As with all operations in GradPad, the `SearchCommand` class handles the execution of `search` operations.

Given below is a series of steps to show how a `search` operation behaves during its execution.

1. The user enters a search command string containing a module code, e.g. "search CS2103T".

2. This calls the `execute` method of the `LogicManager` class with the user input passed in as a string.

3. `Logic.execute()` then calls the `parseCommand`  method of the `GradPadParser` class to parse the string input.

4. `GradPadParser.parseCommand()` sees that this is a search command, and so uses the `SearchCommandParser.parse()` 
method in `SearchCommandParser`.

5. In `SearchCommandParser`, `SearchCommandParser.parse()` extracts the ModuleCode from the string input.

6. A `SearchCommand` is then created with the ModuleCode, and is passed back to the
`LogicManager` in step 2. 

7. `LogicManager` executes the newly created `SearchCommand`.

8. `SearchCommand.execute()` then creates an instance of `ModuleInfoSearcher` to call the `searchModule()` method by
passing in the module code.

9. `searchModule()` method will then take in the module code and retrieve the `ModuleInfo` by calling
`NusmodsData.getModuleInfo()` in the `Nusmods` package.

10. The `ModuleInfo` of the searched module retrieved will then be accessed and formatted according to the display 
requirement.

11. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created to display the module information that has been retrieved.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `search CS2103T` command is executed.

![SearchSequenceDiagram](images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png)

### Tags feature

GradPad allows users to add tags to modules that they add, remove tags from existing modules, list out all
existing tags in GradPad, and filter the `Completed Modules` list by tags.

Tags are represented by `Tag` objects which are referenced by `Module` objects when modules are tagged. 

To prevent duplicate tags from being created everytime a module is tagged (as was the case in the original AB3),
the `GradPad` class uses a `UniqueTagMap` class to keep track of a collection of unique `Tag` objects. With this,
when a user tags a module with an existing tag, `UniqueTagMap` looks for the existing `Tag` object and adds it to
that `Module` object. As such, all modules who use a particular tag now reference that corresponding singular `Tag
` object.

The main benefit of this is evident when GradPad needs to print out a list of all tags, which can be simply done
by printing out `UniqueTagMap`'s tags. Otherwise, one would have to iterate through all `Module` objects,
retrieve all their tags, and then filter them to remove any duplicates.

Following this, `UniqueTagMap` also has to handle the addition and deletion of modules, which is utilized by 
the `GradPad` class's add, edit, and delete operations for modules.

#### Adding a module with tags

1. When a module with tags is going to be added, the `GradPad` class within the `Model` component is passed that newly
 constructed `Module` object from the `Logic` component (see [add feature](#add-feature)).

2. Its `addModule` method is invoked with this object as a parameter.

3. Before adding this module to its list of modules, this new module's tags will first be parsed and replaced with
existing tags where possible. This is done using the`checkAndReplaceTags` method in the `UniqueTagMap` class.

4. The `checkAndReplaceTags` method basically loops through a list of `Tag` objects and checks each one against
the collection of existing `Tag` objects it already holds. If it comes across a "new" `Tag` that already exists
within its collection of tags, it replaces that "new" `Tag` with its existing equivalent `Tag` object in the list.
Otherwise, it adds genuinely new `Tag` objects to its collection.

5. Now that the new `Module` object's tags have been checked and replaced, the model adds this `Module` to its
`UniqueModuleList`.

The following diagram illustrates this flow of logic.

![AddModuleTagsSequenceDiagram](images/AddModuleTagsSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Deleting a module with tags

When a module is being deleted, its `Tag` objects within cannot simply be deleted, since multiple
`Module`s may share the same `Tag` object. Yet at the same time, when a `Tag` is no longer referenced by any `Module`,
it should be removed so that it doesn't loiter around in `UniqueTagMap`. To achieve this, `Tag` objects
store a count of the no. of modules that are currently using it. When this count hits 0, the `Tag` can be safely
 removed.
 
This is the execution flow when a module is deleted:

1. The `removeModule` method in the `GradPad` class is invoked.

2. The `remove` method in `UniqueTagMap` is then invoked with a set of all `Tag` objects belonging to the `Module` that
is to be removed.

3. Within the `remove` method, each `Tag`'s module count is decremented. If the count reaches 0 at this point,
then the `Tag` must be unused by all modules. It is thus removed from the collection of `Tag`s within
`UniqueTagMap`.

4. The `Module` object can now be deleted from the `UniqueModuleList` in the `GradPad` class.

The diagram illustrates this flow of logic:

![DeleteModuleTagsSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteModuleTagsSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Editing a module's tags

When editing a module's tags, the old tags are simply "removed" as when 
[a module is deleted](#deleting-a-module-with-tags), followed by "adding" the new tags, as when
[a module is added](#adding-a-module-with-tags).


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGradPad`. It extends `GradPad` with an undo/redo history,
stored internally as a `gradPadStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the 
following operations:

* `VersionedGradPad.commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current GradPad state in its history.
* `VersionedGradPad.undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous GradPad state from its history.
* `VersionedGradPad.redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone GradPad state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model.commitGradPad()`, `Model.undoGradPad()` 
and `Model.redoGradPad()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGradPad` will be initialized with 
the initial GradPad state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single GradPad state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete CS2103T` command to delete the `CS2103T` Module from the Completed Modules. The 
`delete` command calls `Model.commitGradPad()`, causing the modified state of the GradPad after the `delete CS2103T` 
command executes to be saved in the `gradPadStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted 
GradPad state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add CS2100` to add a new module. The `add` command also calls `Model.commitGradPad()`, 
causing another modified GradPad state to be saved into the `gradPadStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it 
will not call `Model.commitGradPad()`, so the GradPad state will not be saved into the `gradPadStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the 
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model.undoGradPad()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once 
to the left, pointing it to the previous GradPad state, and restores the GradPad to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 
0, pointing to the initial GradPad state, then there are no previous GradPad states to restore. The `undo` command 
uses `Model.canUndoGradPad()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should 
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model.redoGradPad()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once 
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the GradPad to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 
`gradPadStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest GradPad state, then there are no undone GradPad states to restore. 
The `redo` command uses `Model.canRedoGradPad()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the 
user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the GradPad, such as `list`, 
will usually not call `Model.commitGradPad()`, `Model.undoGradPad()` or `Model.redoGradPad()`. Thus, the 
`gradPadStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model.commitGradPad()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing 
at the end of the `gradPadStateList`, all GradPad states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no 
longer makes sense to redo the `add CS2100` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop 
applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire GradPad.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Module Code**: Each module of study has a unique module code consisting of a two- or three-letter prefix that generally denotes the discipline, and four digits.
   * **First digit**: Represents the level of the module, i.e., 1000 indicates a Level 1 module and 2000, a Level 2 module, etc.
   * **Second digit**: Indicates the type of module, i.e., 1 for essential, 2 for elective, 3 for enrichment.
* **Modular Credit (MC)**: A unit of the effort, stated in terms of time, expected of a typical student in managing his/her workload. The MC-value of a module is derived by dividing the estimated total number of workload hours per week for that module by the credit factor of 2.5 (i.e., one MC is equivalent to 2.5 hours of study and preparation per week).

## **Appendix C: Effort**

### 1. NusMods  ![NUSMods](images/nusmods_small.png) <br>
GradPad is tightly integrated with the NUSMods public API by using it to retrieve NUS module information to display to
users. This integration with NUSMods is definitely complex and not easy. Fortunately, one of our team members had some
experience with web development and managed to integrate the API into GradPad. This allows GradPad to 
retrieve up-to-date module data directly from NUSMods, making GradPad more relevant and adaptable.

As if integrating GradPad, a Java application, with a public web API isn't tedious enough, we also had to meet the
project constraint that GradPad should be able to function even without an active connection to the API. Ideally,
it would be straightforward for us to simply scrape data from the API and store it in our own database via a DBMS,
which is generally done in other applications to reduce dependency on external APIs. However, the module also
forbids the use of a DBMS, which meant we had to come up with a way to scrape and store data in local files instead.
At the end of the day, we spent a considerable effort to write a script in Java that scrapes data from the API
, transforms them into Java objects, and serializes them into human-readable JSON files.

### 2. NUS CS Curriculum
Our target audience is Computer Science Undergraduates and so we had to get the NUS CS curriculum and utilize
this data in GradPad. Our initial idea was to just store the entire list of modules in the CS curriculum into GradPad.
However, we soon realized that there are way more modules than we had anticipated as there is a list of GEMs and 
science modules that we had initially missed out. Besides this, there are also preclusions in some modules and
equivalent modules with different module codes. These are tough challenges that we had to brainstorm hard to come up
with innovative solutions to address them. Fortunately, our team managed to address these fundamental problems in the final product.

### 3. UI
Our GradPad Team has spent a considerable amount of effort on the UI aspect, from choosing the position of the result
display and command box input, to the color theme that is the most pleasing to the audience. There should also be a
special mention to Syafiq for coming up with the logo of GradPad from scratch, personalizing GradPad's Ui to our target
audience. Our team absolutely loves the color theme we have ended up with and we believe our target audience (Computer
Science Undergraduate) will too.

### 4. Overall
As a whole, we believe that even though this project was rather demanding and time-consuming, we thoroughly enjoyed 
working with one another. Right from the start, we helped each other with the setting up of Github and the process of
the project's workflow. All of us were also very encouraging and constantly reviewed each other's pull requests with
comprehensive comments, allowing us to learn from each other's strengths in coding. We are definitely proud of GradPad
, and believe that it will serve its purpose to the fullest potential.
