## **Design** 

### Architecture 

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Architecture Sequence](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram2.png)

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `start attempt`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramQuiz.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component 

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and `PerformanceWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component 

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagramNew.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FlashcardParser`, `QuizParser` and `PerformanceParser` classes to parse the user command
 depending on which mode the app is in.
1. `FlashcardParser` and `QuizParser` will result in a `Command` object while `PerformanceParser` will result in a
 `PerformanceCommand` object.
1. Either `Command` or `PerformanceCommand` objects are executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` or `PerformanceCommandResult` object for
 which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` or `PerformanceCommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform
 certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("start attempt")` API call.
The execution for the `end attempt` command is similar.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `start attempt` Command](images/StartAttemptSequenceDiagram.png)


### Model component 

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram2.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the definition book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component 

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram3.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the flashcard book data in json format and read it back.

Additionally, the `Storage` component utilises a different mechanism for storing quiz performance data. The `Storage` component saves quiz performance data in text file format instead
of json format, and it reads it back using a separate set of classes. Hence, quiz performance data is stored and read separately from flashcard book data.

Within the `seedu.address.storage` package, there are several classes that are responsible for loading the performance of previous quiz attempts, and for saving the performance of current quiz attempts. The class diagram below
shows how these classes are related to one another.

![Performance Storage Class Diagram](images/store0.png)

Below are two sequence diagrams. The first sequence diagram shows the interactions between classes in the `seedu.address.storage` package when quiz performance data is read from
the text file and converted into a Performance object. The second sequence diagram shows the interactions between classes in the `seedu.address.storage` package when a Performance object
is converted to data that can be stored in the text file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation** 

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort feature 

The sort feature sorts the flashcards in the flashcard list in either ascending or descending order of priority. This feature is implemented
by creating an instance of `SortCommand` that can be executed on the model of the flashcard list. This particular implementation of the sort
feature was chosen because it accesses and modifies the internal flashcard list in the same way as other commands such as `ListCommand`, hence
preserving consistency in the program design.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort feature works:

![sort0](images/Sort0.png)

When the user executes a sort command, e.g. `sort asc`, `ParserUtil#parseSortOrder()` is called. This function trims whitespaces from the user
input and converts it to lowercase. Hence, user inputs that are in lowercase, uppercase, or both, e.g. `AsC`, are all valid. If the user does not
provide an argument, `asc` will be passed into the `SortCommand` object and the flashcard list will be sorted in ascending order of priority by
default.

The following activity diagram shows how user input is processed:

![sort1](images/Sort1.png)

### Flip feature 

The flip feature flips a flashcard to either show or hide its definition. This feature is implemented by creating an instance of a `FlipCommand` which
is then executed on the model of the flashcard list. This implementation was chosen because it preserves the original fields in a Flashcard such as the
definition. The command execution also works in a similar way to the other commands that were initially implemented.

The following class diagram describes the implementation of the flip feature:

![flip1](images/Flip1.png)

The visible definition of a flashcard is toggled back and forth through a method in the `Flashcard` class through this command. The visible definition is
reflected in the user interface.

The following sequence diagram shows how the flip feature works:

![flip0](images/Flip0.png)

### Quiz feature 

The proposed quiz feature defines a set of sample questions related to CS2040S, containing both MCQ and True-False
 questions, for users to test their knowledge of CS2040S content.

#### Implementation 

The feature is facilitated by `QuizPaser`, `Performance`, `Attempt`, `Response` and `Question`.
`Performance` is a public class that keeps track of past attempts by storing `Attempt` as an internal
 `UniqueAttemptList`.
`Attempt` is a public class keeping track of user responses to a question by storing `Response` as an internal
 `UniqueResponseList`.
  Response is a public class with reference to the `Question` class.
  `Question` is an abstract class and `Mcq` and `TrueFalse` extends Question.

The following shows a Class Diagram of the structure of Quiz components:
![QuizComponents](images/QuizComponentsClassDiagram.png)

`Performance` implements the following operations:

* `addAttempt(Attempt attempt)` - Records an attempt into performance.
* `getAttempts()` - Provides a list of past attempts.
* `getFormattedTimestamp(LocalDateTime timestamp)` - Returns a date and time in format yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.

`Attempt` implements the following operations:

* `addResponse(Response newResponse)` - Records user's new response into current attempt.
* `calculateScore()` - total score of attempt based on number of correct responses.
* `attemptAnalysis()` - Returns a detailed attempt analysis.
* `getResponses()` - Provides a list of responses in current attempt.

`Response` implements the following operations:

* `markResponse()` - Checks if answer of response is correct.

`Question` implements the following operations:

* `getQuestion()`â€‰â€”â€‰Provides both question description and options.
* `checkResponse(String response)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if the response is the same as the correct answer.
* `isMcq()` - Checks if question is Mcq or TrueFalse.
* `setSelectedIndex(int index)` - Sets user answer as selected option.

The general workflow of quiz feature is represented by the following Activity Diagram:
![QuizWorkflow](images/QuizActivityDiagram.png)

### Enter Quiz Feature 
The `enter quiz` command switches interface from Flashcard mode to Quiz mode. This feature is implemented by creating an
instance of `EnterQuizCommand` that can be executed on the model. The `EnterQuizCommand` will return an instance of
`CommandResult` which will inform the `MainWindow` whether it is time to call `handleQuiz()` method to change to current UI.

The following shows a sequence diagram of enter quiz command.
![EnterQuizSequenceDiagram](images/enterQuizSequenceDiagram.png)

### Performance Feature 

This activity diagram shows the possible user flow for a user who wants to check their past quiz records

![Performance](images/Performance_ActivityDiagram.png)

### View Attempt feature 

The view attempt feature allows the user to view a past quiz record given by its index.
 This feature is implemented
by creating an instance of `ViewAttemptCommand` and returns a  `PerformanceCommand` which will trigger the a method in
Performance Window to display the responses accordingly

The following sequence diagram shows how the view attempt feature works:

![ViewAttempt0](images/ViewAttemptCommand_SequenceDiagram.png)
