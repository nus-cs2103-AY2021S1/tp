## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 Purpose

This document details the architecture and software design of the software application CliniCal, which is implemented as part of our CS2103T project. This document is updated when the design and implementation of the software is modified after every milestone. Each milestone will include a version of this document, and the current milestone of this project is `v1.3`.

### 1.2 Audience

The Developer Guide is for those who are interested in understanding the architecture and software design of CliniCal. Specifically, this guide has been written with the current and future CliniCal developers in mind, as this document details the knowledge necessary to modify the codebase to customize for specific operating needs or extend existing functionalities.

### 1.3 Setting up

The code of CliniCal is open sourced and published for free on a git repository hosted on GitHub. Developers who wish to download the code and/or set up an environment to contribute code should refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

1. [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
2. [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
3. [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
4. [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

</p>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center">

    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 3. Execution diagram for "delete 1" command</em>
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 4. Structure of the UI Component</em>
</p>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 2.3 Logic component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 5. Structure of the Logic Component</em>
</p>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

`Logic` uses the `CliniCalParser` class to parse the user command.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<p align="center">

</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.4 Model component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 7. Structure of the Model Component</em>
</p>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the CliniCal application data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div align="center" markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has an `Allergy` list in the `CliniCal` application, which `Patient` references. This allows `CliniCal` to only require one `Allergy` object per unique `Allergy`, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Allergy` object.
    <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 8. Alternative structure for Model component</em>
</div>


### 2.5 Storage component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 9. Structure of the Storage Component </em>
</p>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the patient data in json format and read it back.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Undo/Redo feature

#### 3.1.1 Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCliniCal`. It extends `CliniCal` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `CliniCalStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCliniCal#commit()` — Saves the current CliniCal application state in its history.
* `VersionedCliniCal#undo()` — Restores the previous CliniCal application state from its history.
* `VersionedCliniCal#redo()` — Restores a previously undone CliniCal application state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCliniCal()`, `Model#undoCliniCal()` and `Model#redoCliniCal()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCliniCal` will be initialized with the initial CliniCal application state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CliniCal application state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 10. Initial CliniCalStateList</em>
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient data list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCliniCal()`, causing the modified state of the CliniCal application after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `CliniCalStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CliniCal application state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 11. CliniCalStateList after "delete 5" command</em>
</p>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCliniCal()`, causing another modified CliniCal application state to be saved into the `CliniCalStateList`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 12. CliniCalStateList after "add n/David" command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCliniCal()`, so the CliniCal application state will not be saved into the `CliniCalStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCliniCal()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CliniCal application state, and restores the CliniCal application to that state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 13. CliniCalStateList after undo command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CliniCal state, then there are no previous CliniCal states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCliniCal()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 14. Logic and Model Component Interactions for Undo Command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoCliniCal()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the CliniCal application to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `CliniCalStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CliniCal application state, then there are no undone CliniCal states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCliniCal()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CliniCal application, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCliniCal()`, `Model#undoCliniCal()` or `Model#redoCliniCal()`. Thus, the `CliniCalStateList` remains unchanged.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 15. CliniCalStateList after list command</em>
</p>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCliniCal()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `CliniCalStateList`, all CliniCal application states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

    <img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 16. CliniCalStateList after clear command</em>

</p>

#### 3.1.2 Design consideration

##### 3.1.2.1 Aspect: Execution of undo/redo

* **Current Implementation:** Saves the entire patient details in CliniCal application.

  * Pros:
       * It is easier to implement as the entire list of patients would be saved. The list of patients can then be
  easily loaded to be used or saved for future use by `Model`.

  * Cons:
       * This may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Undo/redo function is handled by each individual command.

  * Pros:
       * The application will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).

  * Cons:
       * The implementation of undo/redo for each specific command must be correct.

##### 3.1.2.2 Aspect: Choice of data structure to store CliniCal application states

 * **Current Implementation:** List with `currentStatePointer` pointing to the current CliniCal state.

    * Pros:
         * It is easier to implement as only a single List is required and all states can be accessed.

    * Cons:
         * This requires constant updating of the `CliniCalStateList` such as purging of redundant states.

 * **Alternative Implementation:** Two Stacks - CommandsExecutedStack and RedoStack

    * Pros:
         * The more intuitive solution as a stack follows the Last In First Out principle. There would be no need for
    any `currentStatePointer` since the current state would be at the top of the stacks.

    * Cons:
         * Harder to implement as two separate stacks would have to be tracked and there would be more dependencies to
    implement before and after the execution of every command.

### 3.2 Add Profile Picture feature

#### 3.2.1 Implementation

This feature allows users to add image files to serve as the patient's profile picture. The mechanism utilises the `StorageManager#addPicture`
method to update the patients' profile pictures.

This feature comprises the `AddProfilePictureCommand` class. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AddProfilePictureSequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 18. Logic Component Interactions for AddProfilePicture Command</em>
</p>

Step 1. User input is parsed to obtain the patient index and file path of the desired profile picture.

Step 2. After successful parsing of user input, the `AddProfilePictureCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3. The `StorageManager#addPicture` method is then called which adds the desired profile picture to the specified patient.

Step 4. Next, the patient's profile picture is updated in the `Model` by calling the `Model#setPatient` method.

Step 5. As a result of the successful update of the patient's profile picture, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### 3.2.2 Design consideration

##### 3.2.2.1 Aspect: Choice of component to save the profile pictures

* **Current Implementation:** Save image file through `StorageManager`.

    * Pros:
         * Mechanism can be extended from the existing architecture that the project is built upon (AB3).

    * Cons:
        * There is a need to implement additional exception handling mechanism to inform the user in cases where invalid file path is provided.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Save image files through a new standalone class eg. `ImageCommand`. This class handles all mechanism related to profile pictures.

    * Pros:
        * Exception handling is simplified as informing the user of invalid file path will be similar to when an invalid command is given.

    * Cons:
        * It is harder to store and update patient's profile pictures.
        * New dependencies need to be created to associate with the newly created `ImageCommand` class.
        * Thus, our team decided to implement the first alternative as it follows the existing architecture closely and minimizes the risk of breaking the existing architecture.

##### 3.2.2.2 Aspect: Image type

* **Current Implementation:** All types of files are accepted, including `.jpg` and `.png`.

    * Pros:
        * User do not need to convert `.jpg` to `.png` file or vice versa before setting desired image file as profile picture.
        * This enhances usability.

    * Cons:
        * Non-image files are still stored in 'data' folder even though the patient's profile picture in CliniCal will not be updated visually.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Accept only some types of files i.e `.jpg` and `.png`.

    * Pros:
        * Acts as a form of validation check and non-image files will not be stored in the 'data' folder. This helps to save disk space.

    * Cons:
        * User is only limited to certain types of image files.
        * As such, our team decided to implement the first alternative as this design maximizes application usability.
        * User will not need to spend additional time converting their images into accepted file types.
        * Furthermore, our team assessed that users can easily delete non-image files from the 'data' folder if the need arises.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### 3.3 View Command History feature

#### 3.3.1 Implementation
This feature allows users to view history of recently used commands.

All entered user inputs (including those in format format or fails to execute) will be stored into a Stack data structure named `commandHistory`
due to its Last In First Out (LIFO) property which allows the most recently used command to display first.

The mechanism utilises the `CommandHistory#getCommandHistory()` to retrieve a list of past used commands from `commandHistory`.

This feature comprises the `HistoryCommand` and `CommandHistory` classes. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/HistorySequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 19. Logic Component Interactions for History Command</em>
</p>

Step 1. User inputs "history" to execute the history command.

Step 2. After successful parsing of user input, the `HistoryCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3. The `CommandHistory#getCommandHistory()` is then called which will return a list of past used commands arranged in the ascending order of time last used.

Step 4. As a result of successful retrieval of the command history, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### 3.3.2 Design Considerations

##### 3.3.2.1 Aspect: Choice of data structure to store commands
* **Current Implementation:** Use of stack ADT

   * Pros:
       * Most recently used command will show up at the top of the list. Also known as Last In First Out (LIFO) method.
   * Cons:
       * Data stored in stack is not persistent.

##### 3.3.2.2 Aspect: How commands are stored
* **Current Implementation:** Store all entered commands

   * Pros:
       * It is easy to implement.
       * The user can check what went wrong with the previous command.

   * Cons:
       * The application will need more memory to store both valid and invalid commands.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Store only commands that are successfully executed

   * Pros:
       * User do not need to view invalid commands.

   * Cons:
       * User cannot check what went wrong with the previous command.

### 3.4 Clear Command History feature

#### 3.4.1 Implementation
This feature allows users to clear history of recently used commands.

The mechanism utilises the `CommandHistory#clearHistory` to clear all stored commands from `commandHistory`.

This feature comprises the `ClearHistoryCommand` and `CommandHistory` classes. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ClearHistorySequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 20. Logic Component Interactions for ClearHistory Command</em>
</p>

Step 1. User inputs "clearhistory" to execute the clear history command.

Step 2. After successful parsing of user input, the `ClearHistoryCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3. The `CommandHistory#clearHistory` is then called which will clear all commands stored in `commandHistory`.

#### 3.4.2 Design Considerations
##### 3.4.2.1 Aspect: Choice of Data Structure to clear commands
* **Current Implementation:** Use of stack ADT

    * Pros:
        * Easy to implement clear function.

    * Cons:
        * Command history is not persistent so recently used commands is only kept during the same usage.

### 3.5 Retrieve and reuse past commands using arrow keys feature

#### 3.5.1 Implementation
This feature allows users to navigate and reuse past commands using up and down arrow keys.

The mechanism utilises the `CommandHistory#peekNext()` and `CommandHistory#peekPrev()`. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the up/down arrow key mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandHistory` will be initialised with the initial state, and the currentStatePointer pointing to that single state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState0.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 21. Initial CommandHistory</em>
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient data list.
The Logic Manager calls `CommandHistory#addUsedCommand()` to add a new command to the stack named `commandHistory`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState1.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 22. CommandHistory after "delete 5" command</em>
</p>

Step 3. The user now decides to reuse `delete 5` in the command history and press the up arrow key (↑).
The actionListener of the TextField will detect the up arrow key being pressed and calls `CommandHistory#peekNext()`.
This will shift the currentStatePointer to the right, pointing to the `delete 5` command and returns it.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState2.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 23. CommandHistory after pressing up arrow</em>
</p>

Step 4. The user now decides not to reuse `delete 5` and go back to the previous command before `delete 5`, i.e. empty.
The user will now press the down arrow key (↓) and the actionListener of the TextField will detect the down arrow key being pressed and calls `CommandHistory#peekPrev()`.
This will shift the currentStatePointer to the left, pointing to the initial state that is empty and returns it.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState3.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 24. CommandHistory after pressing down arrow</em>
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how the up down arrow key mechanism works:

    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 25. Ui Component Interactions for Peeking Commands</em>
</p>


#### 3.5.2 Design Considerations
##### 3.5.2.1 Aspect: How commands are stored
* **Current Implementation:** Peek through all entered commands (including those in wrong format or fails to execute)
    * Pros:
        * Users can edit invalid commands.
        * Users can reuse the same command without typing it all out again.
    * Cons:
        * Only works if the past commands are previously used during the same usage session.
 * **Alternative Implementation:** Peek through commands that can be successfully executed
    * Pros:
        * All past commands reused are valid and can be reused safely.
        * Users require less time to peek through all commands stored in commandHistory as it does not include invalid commands.
    * Cons:
        * Users cannot edit invalid commands and will need to spend more time to retype the valid command.
