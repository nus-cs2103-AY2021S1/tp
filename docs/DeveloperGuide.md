## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ArchiveModeBox`, `HelpWindow`, `PersonCard`
 etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

Several UI parts makes use of a [`DarkTheme.css`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css) file to set the design theme. This file is found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ClientListParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the client list data.
* stores the policy list data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' 
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the client list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the policy list data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Priority Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed priority feature would involve the UI `javafx` feature as well as a newly implemented field for the `Person`.
This field for the `Person` would affect the UI of the I4I. 

There would be 4 settings for the priority feature: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Undefined`. 
If a user never include any of the settings, it would default to `Undefined`. 
The priority feature would change the entries in the client list, changing the colors of the UI for each entry based on the `Priority` assigned for the `Person`. 

![Proposed UI](images/UIPriority.png)

Firstly, an optional `Priority` field would be added to the `Person` class. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the priority mechanism behaves when a client is added. 
Note that this addition of clients via the add command is the same command used when the user launches the application for the first time. 

Step 1. The user will add a client using the GUI and specifies the user to be added. 
The `AddCommandParser` will check if there was an empty string input for the `Priority` field, 
if there is, we will set it as `Undefined`. 
If the user puts any other input other than the predefined inputs (`H` for high, `M` for medium, `L` for low), the user will get an error message. 

Step 2: The `AddCommandParser` object will parse the command into an `AddCommand` object in the `Logic` package to check if the user is an existing user or not.  

Step 3: In the UI, as it is an `AddCommand` object, the `MainWindow` will update the `PersonListPanel`, 
which will call the `updateItem` method based on the `Person` and the `Priority`. This will go to the `PersonListViewCell`, and would attempt to create a `PersonCard` object. 

Step 4: To identify between the different levels of priority, we used a `PriortyIndicatorComponent` class 
to identify the type of person, based on the archive status and the priority. 
The `PriorityIndicatorComponent` class will construct the indicator border and background using `Paint` elements from the `ColorPicker` class. 
The `PersonCard` object will set the background and border based on the returned border and background. 

Step 5: This `PersonCard` object would be returned to the `PersonListViewCell`, updated on the `PersonListPanel` and finally shown in the `MainWindow`. 

The following Sequence Diagram shows how the priority operation works in the UI:

![Proposed Sequence Diagram](images/ImplementationPrioritySequence.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How Priority feature works.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a parser to settle the image inside the UI module. 
  * Pros: Decreased coupling, easier to identify bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Do aside the parser, just put the switch cases inside the `PersonListViewCell`
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (No need to show the parser field).
  * Cons: Increased coupling

### Policy feature

#### Implementation

`Policy` is implemented as shown in this class diagram:

![Policy0](images/PolicyClassDiagram.png)

`PolicyName` and `PolicyDescription` are separate classes rather than string fields.
Implementing `Policy` this way conforms to the same structure as `Person` where string fields are
their own classes.
It also allows for abstraction of methods specified for each of the field classes such as 
checking for validity of each of the individual class's inputs.

Example:

* `PolicyName#isValidPolicyName` & `PolicyDescription#isValidPolicyDescription`

As shown in [**`Model`**](#model-component) above, each `Person` has an optional `Policy` field.
The `Policy` field can be added to a client using the `add` command, which is specified by the
`PolicyName`'s prefix followed by a valid `PolicyName`. The `PolicyName` must be valid and a corresponding
`Policy` must already be in the `PolicyList` maintained by `ModelManager`. The specific `Policy` object
is then referenced from the `PolicyList` and maintained in the `Person` object.

Thus, commands to add `Policy` objects into the `PolicyList` have been implemented.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram that shows how the `AddPolicyCommand`'s `addp` works.

![AddPolicyCommand](images/AddPolicySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddPolicyCommandParser` and `AddPolicyCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

First, `ClientListParser` will parse if the correct command, `addp` in this case, is called. Then,
`AddPolicyCommandParser` will parse the parameters for  `Policy`'s name and description for their validity
and values. `AddPolicyCommandParser` then constructs an `AddPolicyCommand` with the given `Policy` using the
name and description. The `Command` object is returned to `LogicManager` which calls the execute 
method of the `Command`. Execute checks if the `Policy` already exists in the `PolicyList` stored
in `Model` and if it is not, then the `Policy` is added to the `PolicyList`.

A command used to clear the `PolicyList`, `clearp` was also implemented to give the user 
more control over the `PolicyList`. `clearp` clears the `PolicyList` as well as all the 
`Policy`s allocated to clients through interaction with `Model`'s `ClientList` and `PolicyList`.
The command works similar to the `AddPolicyCommand` as illustrated in the sequence diagram
in terms of parsing and command creation, but works differently in `Model` as it clears all
`Policy` objects from the `PolicyList` as well as the `Policy` field of `Person` in
 the `ClientList`.

`PolicyList` is a `List` class stored in `Model`. It stores multiple `Policy` objects in a 
`HashMap`. A `HashMap` was used
because checking if a key is in the `HashMap` can be done quickly. Additionally, `HashMap` 
was chosen over `HashTable` because we do not require the Collection to be synchronized. 
Thus, `HashMap` is more apt due to its higher efficiency and speed.

Lastly, `PolicyList` is also stored in memory as json file. This requires json-adapted classes to be
created. The storage classes are shown in [**`Storage`**](#storage-component). They were implemented
using AB3's storage classes as template.

### Archive feature

#### Implementation

The archive mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager` and `Person`. `Person` contains an archive status, stored internally as `isArchive`. 
`ModelManager` tracks the current viewing mode of the list of `Person`, which is either the active mode or archive mode, stored internally as `isArchiveMode`.
Additionally, `ModelManager` implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#getIsArchiveMode()` — Gets the current archive mode.
* `ModelManager#setIsArchiveMode(...)` — Sets the current archive mode.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getIsArchiveMode()` and `Model#setIsArchiveMode(...)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the archive mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the active mode with `isArchiveMode` set to `false`.

For simplicity, we only show 2 example persons, `david` and `ben`, who are both not in the archive, i.e. their `isArchive` is `false`. 
The user can view both of these persons as he is in the active mode.

![Archive0](images/Archive0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `archive 2` command to archive the 2nd person (`ben`) in the client list. 
The `archive` command creates a new `Person` with `isArchive` set to `true`, then calls `Model#setPerson(...)` to update the model.

This is followed by `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE)` to view all the active persons, 
where `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE` is used to filter `Person`s with `isArchive` set to `false`. 

The 2nd person (`ben`) would be hidden from the user's current view, so he can only see `david`.

![Archive1](images/Archive1.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the archive operation works:

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommandParser` and `ArchiveCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


Step 3. The user executes `list r/` to view the archive. 
The `list r/` command calls `ModelManager#setIsArchiveMode(true)` to set the viewing mode to the archive mode, 
followed by `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ARCHIVE)` to view the archive.
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ARCHIVE` is used to filter `Person`s with `isArchive` set to `true`. 

This causes the user to only view archived persons, which is `ben` in this case.

![Archive2](images/Archive2.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the archive command and list command:

![ArchiveActivityDiagram](images/ArchiveActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Potential issues with other commands and Resolutions

Since the archive is implemented using predicate filtering, it might potentially conflict with `FindCommand`, 
if it were to be implemented in future. However, this can be easily resolved using predicate composition with conjunction 
(AND) logic, a method already available in `Java`’s `Predicate`s. 

As an example, `predicate1` could be a filter for archive, and `predicate2` could be from the find command:

```java
Predicate<Person> composedPredicate = predicate1.and(predicate2);
```

##### Aspect: How archive executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a variable in `Person` to track if he is in the archive.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: With an additional variable in the `Person` class, we must ensure that the reading and updating of the variable is correct. 
  A `Person` would also “know” that he is archived or not, which may not be that ideal.

* **Alternative 2:** Have a separate storage for archive.
  * Pros: A more intuitive solution, and only `Storage`-related modules "knows" about the presence of an archive.
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation the reading and saving of the 2 different storages, and updating of the models are correct, which is time-consuming.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Insurance Agents - Financial Advisors

Insurance agents represent insurance companies, such as AIA and Prudential, as their sales person. They bring in 
clients and promote various insurance schemes. Their clients could be individuals or other businesses. Insurance agents’ 
mode of conducting their job generally involves talking directly to these clients in a face-to-face setting and giving 
their pitch. 

Insurance agents need to be familiar with their clients’ profile, such as their family status, financial needs and 
interests, to better promote their insurance schemes as it gives their pitch a personal touch. 

These users are likely used to typing notes and formulas to manage their clients into a tracker, for example in  Excel 
notebooks. They would add in attributes of users into the tracker, and add in additional functionalities using formulas. 
Thus, they are likely to be comfortable in using a command-line interface.

**Value proposition**: 

Remembering people like a good neighbour.

Successful Financial advisors can have more than a hundred clients. They may not be able to remember the personal 
details of all their clients at once. This product aims to provide a command-line interface for the financial agent to 
record the details of the client, from their scheme details, such as the policies they own, to their personal details, 
like their hobbies. As such, they would be better prepared for meetings and are able to provide a personal touch when 
giving their pitch.
