## 1. Introduction

fitNUS is tailored for **NUS students** that are interested in staying healthy and keeping fit. It is suitable for **all
fitness levels** and is equipped with a **customisable timetable** for you to manage your time wisely and slot in your
workout routines with ease.

This developer guide is for users who are interested in our design philosophy and for future developers of fitNUS.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#3.2-UI-component): Represents the UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#3.3-Logic-component): Executes the command given by the user.
* [**`Model`**](#3.4-Model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#3.5-Storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `exercise_add e/Biceps`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `HomePanel`, `TimetablePanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

User inputs will influence how fitNUS UI will look like. For example, adding calories by `calorie_add c/1500` will cause the CalorieGraph UI component to update in real time.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FitNusParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a new Exercise into fitNUS).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("exercise_delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ExerciseDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores fitNUS data.
* exposes an unmodifiable
    * `ObservableList<Exercise>`
    * `ObservableList<Routine>`
    * `ObservableList<Lesson>`
    * `ObservableList<Slot>`
    * `ObservableList<Body>`
    * `ObservableList<DailyCalorie>`

    that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in `FitNus`, which `Lesson` and `Exercise references. This allows `FitNus` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Lesson` or `Exercise` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 3.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the fitNUS data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Create routine

The feature to create a routine in fitNUS is implemented using `RoutineCreateCommand` class, which inherits from
`Command` class. The argument is supplied after parsing the user input by the `RoutineCreateCommandParser` class.

It is important to note that the Routine object in question must not already exist within fitNUS.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the routine-creating mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `routine_create r/Leg Workout`.

**Step 2:**

This input is passed to `LogicManager` as a String and from there, the input is parsed by the `parseCommand`
method of `FitNusParser`.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command to create a Routine, so it calls the `parse` method of
`RoutineCreateCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

Within `parse`, the name of the routine is produced by `ParserUtil` parsing the given argument. This method then creates
the Routine object and returns it as an argument in the `RoutineCreateCommand`.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this returned `RoutineCreateCommand` to add the Routine into fitNUS.

**Step 6:**

`LogicManager` then saves the updated fitNUS data to the storage.

Given below is the sequence diagram showing how the routine creation command is executed:

![Routine Create](./images/RoutineAddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the activity diagram a user will go through when creating a routine in fitNUS. It shows clearly the input checks at every step and the different errors that will be thrown. 

![Routine create activity](./images/RoutineCreateActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.1 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to create a Routine and add exercises simultaneously in the same command**

* **Alternative 1 (Current implementation)**: No, there should be a seperate command to add Exercise into Routine

    * Pros: Better abstraction by seperating the logic of creating a Routine, and storing Exercise in Routine.
    * Cons: User has to input another command.

* **Alternative 2**: Yes, have a single command to create a Routine and add multiple Exercise to it at the same time.

    * Pros: Saves time for user, typing one long chain.
    * Cons: Increases coupling between Routine and Exercise.

Alternative 1 was chosen for the command to add an Exercise to a Routine to be separate. This is due to the fact that
 we wanted to adhere to the Separation of Concerns Principle. Even though, it comes at the cost of user's time, we
  believe that the trade-off to gain lower coupling and prevent ripple effects across fitNUS was the right choice to
  make.

**Aspect: Whether to implement Tag for Routine**

* **Alternative 1 (Current implementation)**: No, there is no Tag function for Routine.

    * Pros: UI is a lot more concise and condensed..
    * Cons: User might not understand everything about a Routine.

* **Alternative 2**: Yes, we should implement a Tag feature for Routine.

    * Pros: Allow users to understand more about the Routine at a glance.
    * Cons: Cluttering of the UI.

Alternative 1 was chosen to not support Tag for Routine. The UI has a lot of information at the moment, and adding Tag
 to Routine would only serve to confuse the user. Furthermore, users are able to glean which Exercise is in the Routine
  from the UI as of now, and adding Tag would only clutter up the RoutineListCard. A Routine can store many Exercise and
  this is the more important information to display, over Tag.

### 4.2 Add Routine to Timetable

The `TimetableAddRoutineCommandParser` and `TimetableAddRoutineCommand` classes parse and execute the user input
to add a routine to the timetable in fitNUS.

The `TimetableAddRoutineCommandParser` class takes in the user input and parses them to return a
`TimetableAddRoutineCommand` object that contains the routine, day and duration. The `TimetableAddRoutineCommand` class
then executes the command by storing the slot in the timetable.

Note that for the command to be successful, the routine to be added has to exist in fitNUS.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `timetable_add_routine r/Leg workout D/Monday T/1600-1800`.

**Step 2:**

`LogicManager` takes in this input as a String and calls the `parseCommand` method of `FitNusParser` to parse this string.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command add a Routine to Timetable, so it calls the `parse` method of
`TimetableAddRoutineCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

The `parse` method calls the necessary methods of `ParserUtil` to parse the given argument and produce the name, day,
and duration. It uses the name to create the Routine object and returns this object, the day, and the duration as an
argument in `TimetableAddRoutineCommand`.<br>
Note that this Routine object is a placeholder, the actual Routine object in fitNUS is yet to be found.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of this returned `TimetableAddRoutineCommand` to add the Routine into the timetable.<br>
Note that the `execute` method retrieves the actual Routine object in fitNUS before adding it to the timetable.

**Step 6:**

`LogicManager` then saves the updated fitNUS data to the storage.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the
execute("timetable_add_routine r/Leg Workout D/Monday T/1600-1700") API call.

![TimetableAddRoutineSequenceDiagram](images/TimetableAddRoutineSequenceDiagram.png)

### 4.3 Find exercises

The find exercises feature is implemented using `ExerciseFindCommandParser`, as well as the following command:
* `ExerciseFindCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command into fitNUS.

`ExerciseFindCommandParser` takes in the user input and parses them to return a `ExerciseFindCommand` containing the
corresponding predicate for finding the exercises. When executed, `ExerciseFindCommand` will set the predicate of
the respective `FilteredList` for exercises in `ModelManager` such that only exercises matching the predicate will be
displayed in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find exercise mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `exercise_find bench`.

**Step 2:**

This input is passed to `LogicManager` as a String and from there, the input is parsed by the `parseCommand`
method of `FitNusParser`.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command to find exercises, so it calls the `parse` method of
`ExerciseFindCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

Within `parse`, the keywords to match are added to a `List`, and an `ExerciseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object
is created based on this list. A `ExerciseFindCommand` object is created using this
`ExerciseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this returned `ExerciseFindCommand`.
Within `execute`, `ModelManager`'s `updateFilteredExerciseList` method is called with the
`ExerciseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as its argument. This filters out the relevant exercises.

**Step 6:**

The GUI then lists the filtered exercises.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("exercise_find bench")
API call.

![FindExercisesSequenceDiagram](images/FindExercisesSequenceDiagram.png)

### 4.4 Delete lesson

The delete lesson feature is implemented using `LessonDeleteCommandParser`, as well as the following command:
* `LessonDeleteCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command into fitNUS.

`LessonDeleteCommandParser` takes in the user input and parses them to return a `LessonDeleteCommand` object. The
`LessonDeleteCommand` class then executes the command by deleting the lesson from the respective `FilteredList` for
lessons in `ModelManager`.

Note that when a user deletes a lesson in fitNUS, fitNUS will automatically delete any corresponding slots that contain
that lesson from the timetable. The same logic applies when the user deletes a routine. Similarly, when the user edits
a lesson or routine, fitNUS automatically reflects this change in the corresponding timetable slot(s).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete lesson mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `lesson_delete 1`.

**Step 2:**

This input is passed to `LogicManager` as a String and from there, the input is parsed by the `parseCommand`
method of `FitNusParser`.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command to delete lesson, so it calls the `parse` method of
`LessonDeleteCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

Within `parse`, the name of the lesson is produced by `ParserUtil` parsing the given argument. This method then creates
the Lesson object.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this returned `LessonDeleteCommand`.
Within `execute`, `ModelManager`'s `updateFilteredLessonList` method is called. This removes the unwanted lesson.

**Step 6:**

The GUI then lists the deleted lesson.

#### 4.4.1 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to automatically delete the corresponding slot that contains the lesson when the user deletes that lesson**

* **Alternative 1 (Current implementation)**: Yes, fitNUS should automatically delete the corresponding slot, if any.

    * Pros: More user-friendly implementation as the user does not need to delete each timetable slot one by one.
    * Cons: Increases coupling between Slot/Timetable and Lesson.

* **Alternative 2**: No, fitNUS can only delete the lesson if there is no slot that contains it. Else, fitNUS throws an error message.

    * Pros: Adheres to the Separation of Concerns Principle since the slot is not automatically deleted.
    * Cons: Makes it very tedious to delete a lesson if multiple slots in the timetable contain that lesson.

Alternative 1 was chosen for fitNUS to automatically delete any corresponding slots. While we understand that this causes
increased coupling among the different classes, we believe that Alternative 2 is too tedious for the user and
is not practical when there is a substantial amount of data in fitNUS. Suppose there are 10 slots containing the lesson
that the user wants to delete. The user will need to carry out 10 commands to delete those slots before he can delete the lesson.
The cost is too high and such a process is too tedious, hence we decided to stick to Alternative 1 for more practical uses.

    now clear the data and restart, deleting all previous data.
    
## Appendix: Effort

### Overall efforts

Adapting AB3 to fit our vision for fitNUS was no small task. This was everyone's first introduction to a brown-field
software engineering project and the scope and depth of AB3 took everyone by surprise. We faced a lot of difficulties
juggling both understanding and dissecting the code, as well as adhering to the proper workflow arrangement. On top of
refactoring Person into Exercise, we had to find an elegant solution to the other classes of fitNUS, while ensuring low
coupling and abstraction.

### Exercises and Routines

We knew that we wanted to center fitNUS around Exercise. Intertwining of Exercise with Routine, Timetable and the other
classes proved to be extremely challenging. Whenever an Exercise was edited or removed, relevant Routines will have to
changed and similarly edited. We went through several iterations of refactoring these classes due to
design issues as we learnt more about design principles in the course and defensive programming.

### Lessons

We knew another major aspect to fitNUS was Lesson. Intertwining of Lesson and Timetable and the other
classes proved to be extremely challenging. Whenever a Lesson was edited or removed, relevant Lessons will have to be
changed and similarly edited in the Timetable. We went through several iterations of refactoring these classes due to
design issues as we learnt more about design principles in the course and defensive programming.  

### Timetable and Slot

Implementing a Timetable in fitNUS that stores Routines and Lessons prove to be another challenging task.
Since the Timetable has to be able to store both Routines and Lessons, we need to use a parent Activity class and
this requires us to implement Routine and Lesson properly so that they can extend from the Activity class.
Next, we need to think about how to store each Activity in the Timetable with no overlapping time slot.
We decided it is best to use the Slot class to encapsulate each Activity, and the Day and Duration specified by the user.
With the Day and Duration encapsulated, we can then check for any overlapping slots easily.
A lot of meticulous thoughts are required to implement this feature properly due to its dependency with Routine and Lesson.
Whenever a Routine or Lesson is edited or deleted, we need to ensure any corresponding Slots containing them have to be
edited or deleted as well.

### User Interface

We envisioned fitNUS to be more of a "visual" product, where users will feel that the product is intuitive to use and
the interface is lean. We are proud and sure that we have achieved this goal, despite not knowing any JavaFX before
CS2103T.  We are especially proud of the calorie graph that is on the homepage that dynamically updates as the user
enters calories as well as the timetable tab that is able to concisely display the user's routines and lessons. 
We spent a considerable amount of time on independent learning to understand how the graph and tabs can be implemented, 
and how to best integrate these components into fitNUS.

### Conclusion

No matter how much you plan for a project, things will always hiccup. 
We had a lot of unique ideas and features that we wish we could have implemented, but due to the unforeseen workload and the already
large scale of fitNUS, we had to shed some really good ideas. Nevertheless, we are extremely proud of what we have
accomplished with fitNUS. We can say without a doubt, that this was definitely the most challenging and the most
rewarding module yet.
