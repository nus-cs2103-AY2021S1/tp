## Introduction

This is the developer guide for **CLI-nic**, a brownfield project evolved from [AddressBook3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/tp).

CLI-nic is a desktop application to help medical supply managers keep track of medical products and storage.
It is optimized for usage via typing of commands, while the suppliers/warehouses and their associated
product information is shown on our Graphical User Interface (GUI). CLI-nic can be used to store and
retrieve information much faster than traditional GUI apps if you can type fast.

If you are interested in developing CLI-nic, this Developer Guide will introduce to you the architecture
and help you gain an overview of the implementation of the various features and components. You may use the
table of contents below to navigate easily to sections within this document.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [_diagrams_](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the
 user issues the command `delete ct/s i/12`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SupplierListPanel`, `WarehouseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml
` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/ui/MainWindow.java) is
 specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `MacroParser` class to parse the user input.
1. The resultant command string is returned to the `LogicManager` and then parsed by the `ClinicParser`.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a supplier).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("ds i/12")` API call, where there is a saved macro with the alias `ds` for the command string `delete ct/s`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `ds i/12` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

![Structure of the Supplier class](images/SupplierClassDiagram.png)

![Structure of the Warehouse class](images/WarehouseClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the CLI-nic data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Supplier>`, `ObservableList<Warehouse>` and `ObservableList<Macro>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a
 more OOP) model for `Clinic` is given below.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/clinic/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `UserMacros` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `CommandHistory` objects in txt format and read it back.
* can save the CLI-nic data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.clinic.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. Note that the examples given to explain each feature uses full command strings instead of macros so as to show the true format of each command.
Similarly, `MacroParser` has been omitted from the diagrams to reduce clutter. Refer to the [Logic Component](#logic-component) to read how a command would be executed with macros.

### Add feature

The `add` feature will be elaborated in this section by its functionality and path execution with the aid of
Class, Activity, and Sequence Diagrams. It is facilitated by the `AddCommandParser` and the `AddCommand` where
`AddCommandParser` implements `Parser` and the `AddCommand` extends `Command`. These allow the user to
add a supplier/warehouse to the app using the command line.

The following Class Diagram of `AddCommand` shows the interactions between `AddCommand` and other classes
in CLI-nic:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only important
associations are displayed.

</div>

![Add Command Class Diagram](images/AddCommandClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### What Add feature does

The `add` feature allows user to add information for a supplier/warehouse.

A supplier's attributes consist of `name`, `phone` and `email` while a warehouse's attributes consist of
`name`, `phone` and `address`.

The supplier/warehouse can also consist of an optional `remark` attribute.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `add` feature does not
include product information and the `update` feature should be used to associate a supplier/warehouse with a
product and its associated quantity and tags. This is elaborated in the [**`Update`**](#update-product-feature) feature section.

</div>

#### Path Execution of Add Command
The workflow of an `add` command when executed by a user is shown in the Activity Diagram below:

![Add Command Activity Diagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Important features of the Activity Diagram are as follows:

1. The `add` command only allows addition of a single supplier/warehouse for every single command. If two
 or more `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` are provided, the last type specified will be used to process the user's input.
 This applies for all other prefixes as well.

1. After the user calls the `add` command, the code will check for the presence of all the compulsory
 prefixes (i.e. `ct/COMMAND_TYPE`, `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE` and `e/EMAIL` or `addr/ADDRESS` for supplier and warehouse
 respectively) in the input. A `ParseException` will be thrown if any of the compulsory prefixes are not
 present.

   Similarly, `ParseException` will be thrown if there are any invalid prefixes or inappropriate fields
   provided (e.g. input a `String` value for `phone`).

1. `AddCommand` will then be executed. The new supplier/warehouse will be added in the `Model`, allowing
 users to see the added supplier/warehouse.

    If new supplier/warehouse to be added has a duplicate name (i.e. the supplier/warehouse name already
    exist in CLI-nic), it will throw a `CommandException`. Otherwise, a success message will be displayed
    to the user.

In the following section, the interaction between different objects when a user executes an `add` command
will be discussed with the aid of a Sequence Diagram as shown below.

![Add Command Sequence Diagram](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for
`AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of  PlantUML, the lifeline
reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

1. Parsing

    After receiving an input from user for `add` command, `AddCommandParser#parse` will be invoked to tokenize
    the arguments parsed in via `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize`.

    As mentioned above, if any of the compulsory prefixes are not present, `AddCommandParser` will throw a new
    `ParseException` object to the `LogicManager`. A `ParseException` will also be thrown if there are invalid
    prefixes or values provided (e.g. input a `z/` or `String` value for `phone`).

    Subsequently, parsing of general details will occur for both Supplier and Warehouse type. These include
    parsing of `name`, `phone` and `remark`. In addition, since Supplier contains an `email` attribute, parsing
    of this field will be carried out. On the other hand, parsing of `address` will be carried out for
    Warehouse instead.

    At the end, relevant fields present will be set in `Supplier`/`Warehouse`.

    During this parsing process, `ParseException` will be thrown if any of the inputs are invalid.

1. Execution

    `Model#hasSupplier`/`Model#hasWarehouse` will then be executed to check for duplicates (i.e. if
    `Model` already contains a supplier or warehouse with the same name), a CommandException will be
    thrown to inform user of the duplicated supplier/warehouse. Otherwise, the supplier/warehouse will be
    successfully added via `Model#addSupplier`/`Model#addWarehouse`.

1. Result display

    `Model` will be updated to reflect the added supplier or warehouse in GUI and an add success message will be
     displayed to user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Assign macro feature

#### What the assign macro feature does

The assign macro feature allows users to be able to create their own alias for a specific command string which can be used to enter commands after the macro is saved.

#### How it is implemented

The assign macro mechanism is facilitated by 2 components: `AssignMacroCommandParser` and `AssignMacroCommand`.
`AssignMacroCommandParser`'s job is to parse the user input to generate the correct `Alias` and `SavedCommandString`  objects for the `AssignMacroCommand`.
`AssignMacroCommand`'s job is to execute the main logic for updating the model with the new macro.

Given below is an example usage scenario, together with a sequence diagram, to show how the assign macro mechanism behaves at each step.
![Assign Macro Command Sequence Diagram](images/AssignMacroCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The user frequently updates the products under each warehouse and decides to create a new macro with the alias "uw" for the command string "update ct/w" so as to shorten subsequent command inputs.
The user does this by executing the `assignmacro a/uw cs/update ct/w` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. Parsing

   The input string will be passed to the `AssignMacroCommandParser`. By matching the prefixes provided, `AssignMacroCommandParser#parse` then attempts to create a new instances of `Alias` and `SavedCommandString` after matching the prefixes, and throws
an exception to be displayed on the GUI if the alias or command string supplied by the user is invalid, or if any of them is not supplied at all. If all prefixes are parsed without error,
a `Macro` is created from the `Alias` and `SavedCommandString` instances. Then, a new `AssignMacroCommand` instance is created with the new `Macro`.

1. Execution

   The `AssignMacroCommand#execute` method will then be called with the `model` instance. The method will first check if there is any existing macro in the model that uses the same alias.
If that is true, an exception will be thrown. This will be shown on the GUI as an error message. Otherwise, the new macro will be added to the model.

1. Result display

   The `AssignMacroCommand#execute` then passes a `CommandResult` with a success message back to the `LogicManager`. Finally, the model is saved and the GUI is updated with the success message.
The user now updates the quantity of the product "Panadol" in the aforementioned warehouse by simply executing the command `uwm pd/Panadol`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user assigns a macro:
![Assign Macro Command Activity Diagram](images/AssignMacroCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Why it is implemented this way

The main consideration for this feature was what macros should the users be allowed to store, if not everything. We wanted the command to be non-restrictive,
yet still include certain checks to prevent misuse. Hence we decided to throw exceptions for certain types of macros that the user may try to define. In particular, exceptions will be thrown to prevent
assigning a macro with the same alias as a pre-defined command word, so that fundamental commands will not be
overwritten by users. Apart from that, we decided not to allow saved command strings that do not start with a pre-defined command word, as the macros created from these command strings will never
work as they will always give invalid commands. Nonetheless, we decided to allow partial command strings and even full command strings that may not be valid commands as long as they fit the above criteria,
as these macros can be used with additional arguments supplied (possibly making the command valid), or that the command string may be valid upon certain conditions (e.g. after the user adds a supplier).
However, this also means that a valid macro does not guarantee a successful command when used, and error messages may still be displayed for the underlying command of the macro if the underlying command is invalid during the actual use of the macro.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Auto-complete feature

In this section, the functionality of the auto-complete feature will be discussed together with the expected
interface.

#### What is the Auto-complete feature

The auto-complete feature is to help users complete their commands faster through the suggestions of
commands with their corresponding compulsory prefixes based on user input.

#### How it is implemented

All possible commands and their compulsory prefixes are saved in a SortedSet.

When a user types a command on the text box, `AutoCompleteTextField#populatePopup` will be called where the
user’s input will be matched against the set.

If the case of a match, a contextMenu showing all possible auto-complete commands will show up.

This method is implemented such that the results in the contextMenu are constantly updated as the user is
typing and this would make it more intuitive for users.

#### Why it is implemented this way

The auto-complete feature is implemented this way to reduce the need for space on the GUI by only showing
up when there is a potential match. It would also serve to value add to the user experience by speeding up
the process of typing the full command and reduce mistakes by including all the compulsory prefixes.

#### How Auto-complete works

User wishes to enter an `add` command to add a supplier via `add ct/s n/John p/91234567 e/john@example.com
 r/friend`.

Upon typing "a", the auto-complete context menu will pop up showing the possible auto-completed commands
, mainly:

* add ct/s n/ p/ e/ r/

* add ct/w n/ p/ addr/ r/

* assignmacro a/ cs/

Upon seeing this, the user will be able to select from those options or use them as a guide to complete
his/her commands more intuitively.

#### Design consideration

When the full command for single-worded commands are typed in the commandBox, the
AutoCompleteTextField#popUpEntries would be hidden to achieve smoother navigation for users when
accessing commandHistory.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Command history feature

In this section, the functionality of the command history feature will be discussed.

#### What is the command history feature

The command history feature helps user to recall, edit and to reuse long or complicated commands with ease
without having to retype them.

#### How it is implemented

1. When the user starts CLI-nic, a `CommandHistory` model will be initialised to store all the previous command history
entered which is saved in the commandHistory.txt file. Reading from commandHistory.txt is only done once at the start.

1. If the commandHistory.txt file does not exist, the `CommandHistory` model will be initialised with an empty
`CommandHistoryList` which is encapsulated inside `CommandHistory`.

1. When a user enters a valid command, the `execute` method of `LogicManager` will be called and this saves the valid
command entered by the user to the commandHistory.txt file. At the same time, the command will also be added to the
`CommandHistoryList` such that users are able to access the latest history. Since we do not read again from the
commandHistory.txt file, it is necessary to update the in-memory `CommandHistoryList`.

#### Why it is implemented this way

The command history feature is implemented this way to reduce the need for repeated readings from commandHistory.txt
whenever a new valid command is entered by the user. As the commandHistory.txt file gets longer, reading repeatedly
from it can result in a significant reduction in performance.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete feature

The `delete` feature will be elaborated in this section by its functionality, the path execution with the aid of a sequence and an activity diagram.
The details of `DeleteCommand`'s class implementation and its interactions with associated objects will also be discussed.

#### What Delete feature does

The `delete` feature allows user to remove a warehouse or supplier __(case 1)__.
<br>
The `delete` feature also allows user to remove a product from a certain warehouse or supplier __(case 2)__.
<br>
<br>
In case 1, `TYPE` needs to be set to `w` or `s`.
<br>
In case 2, `TYPE` needs to be set to `pw` or `ps`, and a `PRODUCT_NAME` needs to be specified.
<br>
<br>
The deletion is limited to the items shown in the list displayed in GUI, and is done one item at a time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Path Execution of Delete Command

The workflow of a `DeleteCommand` when executed by a user is shown in the activity diagram below:

![Delete Command Activity Diagram](images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)
<br>

With reference to the activity diagram above, the user input will be sent to `DeleteCommandParser` for parsing.
The `DeleteCommandParser` will check if the compulsory prefixes are present (i.e. `ct/TYPE` and `i/INDEX`) and the corresponding
argument values are all valid.
A `ParseException` will be thrown if the check fails.

If the `TYPE` parsed indicates a product deletion (via `ct/ps` or `ct/pw`), an additional field `PRODUCT_NAME` is parsed with its prefix and value checked.

Next, a new `DeleteCommand` will be generated and executed. There are four possible paths for the `delete` command:

1. The target to delete is a `supplier`/`warehouse` <br>
CLI-nic finds the target `supplier`/`warehouse` at the specified `INDEX` of the displayed list and remove it completely.

1. The `INDEX` specified is invalid (e.g. exceeds the length of the list) <br>
A `CommandException` error message will be thrown.

1. The target to delete is a `product` in a particular `supplier` <br>
CLI-nic finds the target `supplier` at the specified `INDEX` of the displayed supplier list, and retrieve its product list.<br>
It finds the `product` with specified `PRODUCT_NAME` and remove it from the product list.

1. No `product` has the `PRODUCT_NAME` in the target warehouse/supplier <br>
A `CommandException` error message will be thrown.

#### Structure of Delete command

We demonstrate the structure of the `delete` feature implementation below.

![Delete Command Class Diagram](images/DeleteCommandClassDiagram.png)
<br>

Note that some commonly applied methods (such as getter/setter methods for each attribute) are not included to reduce verbosity.

#### Delete Command's interaction with related objects

In the following section, the interaction between Delete Command and its associated objects in the delete feature will be discussed.
The sequence diagrams below demonstrate the workflow in the deletion feature.

##### Deletion of a supplier/warehouse

![Delete Command Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<br>


1. Parsing <br>

    CLI-nic's `ClinicParser` will parse the user input and if the `delete` command word is present, the parser will try to parse the
    input to generate a valid `DeleteCommand` via `DeleteCommandParser`. <br>

    Checks for compulsory prefixes and valid arguments (`ct/TYPE` and `i/INDEX` in this case) are done. The code will throw a `ParseException` if the check fails.<br>

    If multiple entries of `ct/TYPE` or `i/INDEX` are found, the last entry will be used as the argument. <br>

    Afterwards, all the valid arguments (`INDEX` and `TYPE`) will create a new `DeleteCommand`, which will be executed.

1. Execution <br>

    The `DeleteCommand` is executed via a `execute` call from `LogicManager`.
    The workflow for an execution of `DeleteCommand` is as shown in the Sequence Diagram below:<br>

    ![Delete Command Execution Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png) <br>

    Using the `targetType` attribute, the execution is first classified as either Supplier deletion (`s`) or Warehouse deletion (`w`). <br>

    Base on the classification, the model will retrieve the relevant displayed list of warehouse/supplier via `model#getFilteredWarehouseList()`/`model#getFilteredSupplierList()`.

    It then locates the warehouse/supplier entry that user wants to delete via the `INDEX` passed in.

    Afterwards, `model#deleteWarehouse`/`model#deleteSupplier` will remove the target entry from the list in the `model`. The `model` will then update the displayed list.

1. Result display <br>

    With the deletion completed, the Model will update the filtered lists of `Supplier` and `Warehouse` to be displayed in the UI.
    A `CommandResult` will be returned to the `LogicManager` with a success message, which will be shown to the user in the UI.

##### Deletion of a product

![Delete Command Sequence 2 Diagram](images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram2.png)
<br>

1. Parsing

    The parsing workflow is the same except that now an additional field `pd/PRODUCT_NAME` will be checked (with both prefix and argument) and parsed. <br>

    Afterwards, all the valid arguments (`INDEX`, `TYPE` and `PRODUCT_NAME`) will create a new `DeleteCommand`, which will be executed.

1. Execution

    The `DeleteCommand` is executed via an `execute` call from `LogicManager`.
    The workflow for an execution of `DeleteCommand` is as shown in the Sequence Diagram below:<br>

    ![Delete Command Execution Sequence 2 Diagram](images/DeleteCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram2.png) <br>

    Using the `targetType` attribute, the execution is now classified as either Supplier-related product deletion (`ps`) or Warehouse-related product deletion (`pw`). <br>

    Based on the classification, the model will again retrieve the relevant displayed list of warehouse/supplier via `model#getFilteredWarehouseList()` or `model#getFilteredSupplierList()` .

    It then locates the respective warehouse/supplier entry at the `INDEX` passed. A product in this entry is to be deleted.

    Next, the product matching the required `PRODUCT_NAME` will be retrieved via `getProductByName`, and an updated target entry with this product removed will be returned through `removeProduct` call.

    Afterwards, `model#setWarehouse`/`model#setSupplier` will replace the old entry with the updated target entry from the list in the `model`. The `model` will then update the displayed list.

1. Result display <br>

    With the deletion completed, the Model will update the filtered lists of `Supplier` and `Warehouse` to be displayed in the UI.
    A `CommandResult` will be returned to the `LogicManager` with a success message, which will be shown to the user in the UI.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit feature
The `edit` feature will be elaborated in this section by its functionality and path execution with the aid of Class, Sequence and an Activity Diagrams.

The Class Diagram of `EditCommand` shows the interactions between EditCommand and other classes in CLI-nic.

Only important associations are displayed in class diagram below:

![Edit Command Class Diagram](images/EditCommandClassDiagram.png)

#### What Edit feature does
The edit feature allows user to edit a supplier/warehouse information. This include `name`, `phone`, `remark`, a supplier's `email` and a warehouse's `address`.

This is important as warehouses and suppliers might change their contact details from time to time, and the user has to be able to edit this information quickly.

One thing to note is edit feature does not allow users to edit any `product` associated with a particular supplier or warehouse. To edit the product quantity or tag of a product, `update` feature should be used instead. This is elaborated in the [**`Update`**](#update-product-feature) feature section.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Path Execution of Edit Command
The workflow of an `edit` command when executed by a user is shown in the activity diagram below:

![Edit Command Activity Diagram](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)


Important features of the Activity Diagram are as follows:

1. The `edit` command only allows editing of a single warehouse or supplier for every single command. If two or more `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` are provided, the last type specified will be used to process user's input. This also applies for other prefixes.

1. If the compulsory prefixes (i.e. `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` and `i/INDEX`) are not present, `ParseException` will be thrown.

   Similarly, `ParseException` will be thrown if no field for editing of suppliers or warehouses is provided. This also applies if there are any inappropriate fields supplied (e.g. `i/test` or `p/test`).

1. `EditCommand` will then be executed. The edited supplier or warehouse will be updated in the model, allowing users to see the changes done for the respective supplier or warehouse.

   If the edited fields result in no changes to the existing supplier or warehouse, a `CommandException` will be thrown to remind user that the supplier or warehouse will be unchanged.

In the following section, the interaction between different objects will be discussed with the aid of a Sequence Diagram to understand the workflow when a user executes an `edit` command.

![Edit Command Sequence Diagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

1. Parsing

   After receiving an input from user for edit command, `EditCommandParser#parse` will be invoked.

   As mentioned in above section, if either one of the compulsory prefixes is missing, `ParseException` will be thrown to remind users. Furthermore, invalid values supplied for `type` and `index` (e.g. `i/test`), a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   An attempt to determine the correct type and creating the relevant `EditDescriptor` will then be carried out. During this process, if incorrect prefixes such as an `email` prefix for warehouse or an `address` prefix for supplier was found, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

   It should be noted that both `EditSupplierDescriptor` and `EditWarehouseDescriptor` are subclasses of `EditDescriptor`. All three classes are inner classes of `EditCommand`. Despite being inner classes, they work as crucial helper classes for `EditCommand` to execute `edit` feature smoothly.

   This inheritance relationship is shown below:

   ![Edit Command Descriptor Class Diagram](images/EditDescriptorClassDiagram.png)

   The logical workflow of creating an appropriate `editDescriptor` is shown in the sequence diagram below:

   ![Edit Command Descriptor Sequence Diagram](images/EditCommandDescriptorSequenceDiagram.png)

   Parsing of general details will occur for both Supplier and Warehouse type. These include parsing of `Name`, `Phone` and `Remark`.

   In addition, since Supplier contains an `Email` attribute, parsing of this field will be carried out. On the other hand, parsing of `Address` will be carried out for Warehouse instead.

   At the end, relevant fields present will be set in `editDescriptor`.

   During this parsing process, `ParseException` will be thrown if any of the inputs are invalid.

1. Execution

   EditCommand will be executed and the workflow is shown in the Sequence Diagram below:

   ![Edit Command Execution Sequence Diagram](images/EditCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png)

   The list of suppliers or warehouses currently shown to user is first obtained from `Model` for retrieval of appropriate entity.

   An entity with edited properties is created with `EditCommand#createEditedSupplier` or `EditCommand#createEditedWarehouse`.

   If `Model` already contains a supplier or warehouse with the same name, a `CommandException` will be thrown to inform user of the duplicated supplier or warehouse.

   Similarly, a `CommandException` will be thrown if input result in same supplier or warehouse (i.e. supplier or warehouse information unchanged).

1. Result display

   `Model` will be updated to reflect the edited supplier or warehouse in GUI and an edit success message will be displayed to user.


#### Why Edit feature is implemented this way
The `edit` command is implemented this way to ensure consistency with the other commands in the application. This helps to minimise any potential confusion for the users.

In addition, it was intended for `EditCommand` to throw out a `CommandException` when none of the field changes an existing entry. This serves as a reminder for users in case they made a minor mistake in their command.

Besides, a command type prefix, `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` is required in the implementation of `edit` command to indicate whether user wishes to edit a warehouse or supplier entry.

Without this, an alternative would be for a `TYPE` parameter, where user have to indicate `supplier` or `warehouse`. However, this may not be suitable for our target user, who wishes to update information quickly.

Lastly, another alternative considered was to create separate commands for warehouses and suppliers respectively.

For example, `editw` and `edits` to represent edit warehouse and edit supplier. However, this might increase duplicated codes, since minimal changes to the code would be found for each class of command.

Therefore, our team decided to implement `edit` command by taking in prefixes and throwing our relevant exceptions at appropriate points after considering code quality and end user experience.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find feature

#### What Find feature does
The find feature allows users to find all relevant suppliers or warehouses by their names, by their remarks and/or by
names of the products sold/stored. Users are able to search for relevant suppliers or warehouses using either only one
or a combination of these criteria. Note that users are only able to search for either suppliers or
warehouses at any one time and not both at the same time.

#### How it is implemented
![Find Command Activity Diagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. After the `find` command is called with the relevant prefixes, the user input will be sent
to `FindCommandParser` for parsing.

1. `FindCommandParser` will then check if the compulsory prefix `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` is present. If the user enters
`ct/COMMAND_TYPE` prefix more than once, only the last prefix specified will be used to process user's input. If the
prefix `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` is not present, a `ParseException` will be thrown and an invalid command format message
will be shown to the user.

1. If command type prefix is present, `FindCommandParser` will then proceed to check for the existence of at least
one of the following prefixes `n/NAME`, `r/REMARK` and `pd/PRODUCT`. If none is found or invalid prefixes are provided,
a `ParseException` will be thrown and an invalid command format message will be shown.

1. Once the user has entered the correct format, `FindCommandParser` will create a new `FindCommand` with either a
`SupplierPredicate` or `WarehousePredicate`. This `FindCommand` will then be executed and the relevant supplier(s)
or warehouse(s) will be filtered out.

1. The model will then display the relevant supplier(s) or warehouse(s) to the user via the method
`model#getFilteredSupplierList()` or `model#getFilteredWarehouseList()`.

#### Why it is implemented this way
The `find` command is implemented this way to ensure consistency with the other commands in the application regarding
the prefixes. This helps to minimise any potential confusion for the users by standardising the prefixes that `find`
command takes in with the other relevant commands. In addition, a command type prefix, `ct/COMMAND_TYPE` is required in the
implementation of `find` command to indicate whether the user wishes to search for suppliers or warehouses. Without this
prefix, the application will not be able to know if the user wishes to search for suppliers or warehouse.

#### Alternatives considered
In our previous implementation, we did not require the user to enter the command type prefix. Instead, we only required
the user to enter the `TYPE` parameter in the form of either `supplier` or `warehouse`. However, typing the whole word
out may not have been suitable for our target user, who wishes to find suppliers or warehouses quickly. Hence, our team
decided to use a command type prefix in place of a `TYPE` parameter, which is shorter and easier to type.

In our current implementation, users are required to enter at least one or a combination of the following prefixes:
`n/NAME`, `r/REMARK`, `pd/PRODUCT`. This allows the application to determine which criterion/criteria to filter by.
Another alternative that was previously implemented was to split the find command into three separate commands: `findn`
which allows users to search by name, `findr` which allows users to search by remarks and `findp` which allows users to
search by products. However, this implementation was deemed unsuitable as it increased code duplication with minimal
changes between the different classes. In addition, by splitting into three separate commands, users are unable to
search for suppliers or warehouses using multiple criteria. They could only search by name, by remark or by product in
any single command. By using prefixes, users are able to search for suppliers or warehouses using any combination of
name, remark and product. Taking the aforementioned points into consideration, our team has therefore decided to
implement the `find` command by taking in prefixes and throwing our relevant exceptions at appropriate points after
considering code quality and end user experience.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Help feature
The `help` feature will be elaborated in this section by its functionality.

#### What Help feature does
`help` feature allows user to view help messages for all commands briefly or help message for specific commands. This allows user to have an over-arching idea of what they can do in **CLI-nic**. Afterwards, a user can read up about the command format and sample commands by typing in `help COMMAND`.

#### Path Execution of Help Command
An Activity Diagram showing the workflow of `help` command is shown below:

![Help Command Activity Diagram](images/HelpCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Important features of the Activity Diagram are as follows:

1. If no `COMMAND` is specified after `help`, a generic help message, consisting of all commands available in **CLI-nic** will be shown to users.

1. If more than one `COMMAND` is given, or if the `COMMAND` specified is not recognised in **CLI-nic**, a `ParseException` will be thrown to inform the user.

1. If a valid `COMMAND` is specified, the `help` message relevant to the command (includes what the command does, command format and sample commands) will be displayed to users.

#### Why Help feature is implemented this way
Instead of providing a link and asking users to read the user guide, it would be more convenient for users to access the help message for each command within the application itself. This allows user to instantly know what to key into the command box instead of switching between user guide in the browser and **CLI-nic**. In addition, this allow users to access the `help` page even without an internet connection as well.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List Macros feature

#### What the List macros feature does

The list macros feature allows users to be able to view all presently saved macros in the application.

#### How it is implemented

The list macros feature is facilitated by the ListMacroCommand, whose job is to retrieve to list of macros and process it into a suitable format to be displayed to the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario

The user decides to check what macros he/she has saved before. The user does this by executing the `listmacro` command.

1. Parsing

   Since there are no arguments needed for this command, the `ClinicParser` directly creates the `ListMacroCommand`.

1. Execution

   `LogicManager` will then call `ListMacroCommand#execute` with the `Model` instance. `ListMacroCommand#execute` will retrieve the macro list from the `Model`.
If the list is empty, the method will terminate by returning a `CommandResult` with a message to notify the user that there are no presently saved macros.
Otherwise, the list of macros will be formatted into a readable format.

1. Result display

   The success message which contains the formatted list will be passed in a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`, to be displayed on the GUI without overriding the existing lists for suppliers and warehouses.

#### Why it is implemented this way

The main implementation consideration of this feature would be the display of the list. The list macros feature was implemented such that it does not use the same display section as the warehouse or supplier lists so that the user would not have to execute and additional command to restore the
supplier or warehouse lists. I decided not to include a separate display section to display the list of macros either as this feature is designed for advanced users and that the list of macros would not need to be displayed on
screen except when needed. Hence it is implemented such that it will be displayed with the success message instead, so that the user can quickly refer to the macro list and then proceed to use the intended macro straight after, where
it would then be no longer necessary to keep the macro list on the display.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List Suppliers and Warehouses feature
The list Suppliers and Warehouses feature will be elaborated in this section by its functionality.

#### What List Suppliers and Warehouses feature does
The list Suppliers and Warehouses feature allows user to list all suppliers and warehouses stored in **CLI-nic**. This feature allows users to retrieve back all suppliers and warehouses in the displayed supplier and warehouse lists after executing a `view` or `find` command.

#### Path Execution of List Command
1. Parsing

   User input will be parsed, ignoring any additional arguments after `list` command word. A `ListCommand` will be created and executed.

1. Execution

   Filtered supplier and warehouse list in `Model` will be updated with a `Predicate` to show all suppliers and warehouses.

1. Result Display

   A command success message will be displayed, specifying that all suppliers and warehouses has been listed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remove Macro feature

#### What the remove macro feature does

The remove macro feature allows users to be able to remove an existing macro with a specific alias created earlier.

#### How it is implemented

The remove macro mechanism is facilitated by 2 components: `RemoveMacroCommandParser` and `RemoveMacroCommand`.
`RemoveMacroCommandParser`'s job is to parse the user input to generate the correct `Alias` objects for the `RemoveMacroCommand`.
`RemoveMacroCommand`'s job is to execute the main logic for updating the model with the specified macro removed.

Given below is an example usage scenario, together with a sequence diagram, to show how the remove macro mechanism behaves at each step.
![Remove Macro Command Sequence Diagram](images/RemoveMacroCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The user decides that he/she no longer needs the macro with the alias "uw" and decides to remove it. He does this by executing the `removemacro uw` command.

1. Parsing

   The input string will be passed to the `RemoveMacroCommandParser`. By matching the prefixes provided, `RemoveMacroCommandParser#parse` then attempts to create a new instance of `Alias` by parsing the arguments provided. If the `Alias` is
invalid, an exception will be thrown which will be shown as an error message on the GUI. Otherwise, a `RemoveMacroCommand` instance is created with the new `Alias`.

1. Execution

   `RemoveMacroCommand#execute` is then called with the model instance, which first attempts to retrieve the existing macro in the model with the `Alias` specified by calling the `model#getMacro` method.
This macro is returned in an optional wrapper, and an exception will be thrown if it is empty, where an error message will be displayed on the GUI. Otherwise, the
retrieved macro will be removed from the model.

1. Result Display

   The `RemoveMacroCommand#execute` then passes a `CommandResult` with a success message back to the `LogicManager`. Finally, the model is saved and the GUI is updated with the success message.

1. Result Display <br>

    The `RemoveMacroCommand#execute` then passes a `CommandResult` with a success message back to the `LogicManager`. Finally, the model is saved and the GUI is updated with the success message.

    The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user updates a product:

### Undo/redo feature

The implementation of undo/redo takes reference from the [AddressBook3's proposed implementation](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature), with some modification
on the storage of versioned data.

#### Implementation

The current undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedClinic`.
It extends `Clinic` with an undo/redo history, stored internally via `undoVersionStack` and `redoVersionStack`.
It also stores a `currentClinic` to facilitate the storing of current version of data into the correct stack.
Additionally, it implements 3 other major operations:

* `VersionedClinic#save()` — Saves the current CLI-nic version in its history.
* `VersionedClinic#undo()` — Recovers the previous CLI-nic version from its history.
* `VersionedClinic#redo()` — Restores a previously undone CLI-nic version from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveVersionedClinic()`, `Model#undoVersionedClinic()` and `Model#redoVersionedClinic()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedClinic` will be initialized with the initial CLI-nic state, and the `currentClinic` pointing to that single CLI-nic state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete ct/w i/2` command to delete the 2nd warehouse in the displayed warehouse list. <br>
The `delete` command then calls `Model#saveVersionedClinic()`, causing the CLI-nic version prior to the warehouse deletion (i.e. the `currentClinic`) to be saved in the `undoVersionStack`, and the `currentClinic` is now updated to the newly modified version.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add ct/s n/David Co …​` to add a new supplier. <br>
The `add` command also calls `Model#saveVersionedClinic()`, causing the `currentClinic` version to be saved into the `undoVersionStack` again and updated to the newly modified version.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveVersionedClinic()`, so the `currentClinic` will not be saved into the `undoVersionStack` and updated.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the supplier was a mistake and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. <br>
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoVersionedClinic()`. The `undoVersionStack` will pop the most recent version of CLI-nic data stored, recovers the CLI-nic to that version. <br>
The `currentClinic` version will be stored in `redoVersionStack` and set to this most recent version popped.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `undoVersionStack` is empty, suggesting to the initial CLI-nic version, then there are no previous CLI-nic version to recover. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoClinic()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoClinic()`, which pops the most recent undone version of CLI-nic data from `redoVersionStack` and recovers the CLI-nic to that version.
Correspondingly, the `currentClinic` version will be stored in `undoVersionStack` and set to this most recent undone version popped.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `redoVersionStack` is empty, suggesting to the latest CLI-nic version, then there are no undone CLI-nic version to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoClinic()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. <br>
Commands that do not modify the CLI-nic data, such as `list`, will not call `Model#saveVersionedClinic()`, `Model#undoVersionedClinic()` or `Model#redoVersionedClinic()`.
Thus, the `undoVersionStack`, `redoVersionStack` and `currentClinic` remain unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveVersionedClinic()`. <br>
Note here all CLI-nic versions stored the `redoVersionStack` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add ct/s n/David Co …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** It is common practice to remove any redoable version of data after each editing on the current data. For example, type `test` in any .txt file, undo once and type `new` again. Then trying to redo the previous undone text editing will not work.

</div>

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CLI-nic into two stacks for undo and redo.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the warehouse/supplier being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Update product feature

#### What the update product feature does

The update product feature allows users to modify the quantity or tags of existing products listed under suppliers and warehouses, or add new products to their existing lists.

#### How it is implemented
The update product mechanism is facilitated by 3 major components: `UpdateCommandParser`, `UpdateCommand`, and the `UpdateProductDescriptor`.
`UpdateCommandParser`'s job is to parse the user input to generate the correct `Type`, `Name`, `Index`, and `AssignMacroDescriptor` objects for the `UpdateCommand`.
`UpdateCommand`'s job is to execute the main logic for generating the updated list of products for the model.
`UpdateProductDescriptor`'s job is to serve as a medium to allow the `UpdateCommandParser` to pass a specification of the updated product to the `UpdateCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario, together with a sequence diagram, to show how the update product mechanism behaves at each step.
![Update Product Command Sequence Diagram](images/UpdateCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

After using the `list` command to display all warehouses and suppliers, the user decides to update the stock for a product called 'Xodol' with a new quantity of 97 units
in the warehouse at index 1 of the warehouse list. The user also decides that he wants to give 'Xodol' a tag 'cold'.
The user does this by executing the `update ct/w i/1 pd/Xodol q/97 t/cold` command.

1. Parsing

   The input string will be passed to the `UpdateCommandParser`. By matching the prefixes provided, `UpdateCommandParser#parse` then attempts to create new instances of `Index` for the supplier/warehouse
and a new `Name` for the product. A new `UpdateProductDescriptor` will then be created with the provided quantity and tags, if any. An exception will be thrown if any of the arguments are invalid, or if the type, index and product name are not supplied. If so, an error message will be presented on the GUI.
Otherwise, the method will create an `UpdateCommand` with the `Type`, the warehouse/supplier `Index`, the product's `Name`, and the `UpdateProductDescriptor`.

1. Execution

   The following sequence diagram zooms in on how the `UpdateCommand#execute` is implemented:
![Update Product Command Execution Sequence Diagram](images/UpdateCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png)

   `UpdateCommand#execute` is called with the `Model` instance. The method will first retrieve the filtered warehouse/supplier list from the model. The method then attempts to retrieve the warehouse/supplier from the list at the supplied index. If the index is greater than the size of the supplier/warehouse list, `CommandException` is thrown, otherwise, the `UpdateCommand#execute`
method copies the existing product set for that warehouse/supplier to a new `Set<Product>`.

   `UpdateCommand#execute` then checks if a `Product` of the same `Name` as the `Product` to be updated exists in the `Set<Product>`.
If the `Product` exists, the method does an additional check to ensure that either the tag(s) or quantity (or both)
is supplied in the `UpdateProductDescriptor`, failing which, an exception is thrown. If the check passes, the original
`Product` is removed from the set.

   `UpdateCommand#createUpdatedProduct` then creates a new product based on the product name and `UpdateProductDescriptor`. The `execute` method then adds the updated `Product` to the `Set<Product>`, and creates an updated
warehouse/supplier with the updated product. The method then updates the model with the edited warehouse/supplier, and the `FilteredWarehouseList` to be displayed to the user later.

1. Result display

   The method then passes a `CommandResult` with a success message back to the `LogicManager`. Finally, the model
is saved and the GUI is updated with the success message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user updates a product:
![Update Product Command Activity Diagram](images/UpdateCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Why it is implemented this way and what alternatives were considered
The main design considerations associated to the feature include:

* Should the command be separated for suppliers and warehouses.
* What should the format of the command be.
* Should the adding of new products be facilitated by this command or should it only deal with existing products.
* How should the feature enforce separate requirements for new and existing products.

The consideration of whether there should be separate commands to update products under warehouses or suppliers firstly depend on the similarity between the products under both types.
Initially, we considered that supplier products should only have fields for names and tags, while the warehouse products should only have fields for quantities, as it is arguable that the quantity for suppliers
 may not be known, and that tagging of warehouse products may not be very important. However, we later decided that it is better to give users this flexibility to include any
 tags or quantities associated to the product regardless of supplier or warehouse, as these requirements may differ from user to user, and it may not be beneficial to restrict users as such.
 Then this decision would mean that the updating of products for warehouse and supplier was very similar, and hence we felt that it may also be more user-friendly to combine the 2 into
 one command so that users do not need to learn an additional command.

Initially, the supplier/warehouse to update the product was referenced by the user using the warehouse/supplier's full name. This allowed the user to update the specific supplier/warehouse regardless of the list view
so that the same update command will reproduce the same results regardless of the display, and so that the user does not have to enter an additional list command if the supplier/warehouse is not presently displayed.
However, this would mean that if the user is manually typing the command, it would be take a long time to enter the command if the supplier/warehouse name is very long, and it is also more prone to typos. Hence we decided
to make the compromise to use list indexing instead, standardising the format with the other commands, as we felt that for most use cases, using the index to reference the supplier/warehouse would be more efficient for the user,
 and that was our main priority.

Similar to the decision to combine the command for both supplier and warehouse, we decided to allow the update product command to add the product to the warehouse/supplier even if it does not presently exist for that supplier/warehouse, instead of having a separate command
just for adding products, so as to minimise the total number of commands. With this, all product additions and modifications (excluding deletion) will be processed by the same update command, which also removes the need for users to
check if a product exists for a supplier/warehouse before updating the product listing.

This combination of commands, however, brings up the consideration of how to enforce the separate requirements for new and existing products. Specifically, if it is a new product,
it is logical that the user may not supply the tag or quantity prefixes, but if it is an existing product, then not specifying both prefixes would mean that the user is not performing
any update at all. Hence the user should be required to supply at least 1 of the 2 optional prefixes mentioned above for adding new products, which would mean the application should show an error message if the user does not specify either of the optional arguments
and the product does not exist under the specified warehouse/supplier in the model. In general, however, the check of whether certain prefixes are supplied falls under the role of the `Parser` classes,
while the check of whether an entity exists in the model falls under the role of the `Command` classes, where the `Parser` is independent of the model. Hence we decided to implement an additional `UpdateProductDescriptor` class to provide a wrapper of
the product specification so that both checks can be done by the `UpdateCommand` without exposing the implementation details of the prefixes to the `UpdateCommand` class or using null values in the `UpdateCommand` fields. The `UpdateCommand` can then use the `UpdateProductDescriptor`
to both execute the checks and create the updated product.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View feature
The `view` feature will be elaborated in this section by its functionality and path execution with the aid of Sequence and Activity Diagrams.

#### What View feature does
`view` command allows user to view a particular warehouse or supplier in warehouse or supplier list displayed.

This allows users to view the details of a specific warehouse or supplier which they might be interested to contact for further details. This feature is optimised to be used with `find` command.

For each command, only one warehouse or one supplier can be requested for viewing.

#### Path Execution of View Command
The workflow of a `view` command when it is executed by a user is shown in the Activity Diagram below:

![View Command Activity Diagram](images/ViewCommandActivity.png)

Important features of the Activity Diagram are as follows:

1. When a user's input is parsed, `ViewCommandParser` checks if both command type and index are present in the input.

   A `ParseException` will be thrown if either one or both are missing in user's input.

1. Only 2 `COMMAND_TYPE` are allowed. They are `ct/s` and `ct/w`.

   Any invalid values for prefixes (e.g. invalid `COMMAND_TYPE` specified), a `ParseException` will be thrown.

1. If parsing is successful, `ViewCommand` will be created and executed.

   If `INDEX` specified by user is greater than the size of supplier or warehouse list, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

1. At the end, a `view` command success message will be displayed and the relevant supplier or warehouse list GUI will only show the requested supplier or warehouse.

The logical workflow of this process is further explained in the Sequence Diagram below:

![View Command Sequence Diagram](images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


1. Parsing

   Upon receiving user's input, `ViewCommandParser#parse` will be invoked.

   As mentioned in above section, a `ParseException` will be thrown if the values specified for prefixes are invalid (e.g. wrong type or does not conform to constraints of the prefixes).

   Any wrong prefixes present will also result in `ParseException`.

   `ViewCommand` is then created and executed.

1. Execution

   The workflow for an execution of `ViewCommand` is as shown in the Sequence Diagram below:

   ![View Command Execution Sequence Diagram](images/ViewCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png)

   Supplier or warehouse at the specified index is first retrieved from `supplierList` or `warehouseList` currently displayed in GUI accordingly.

   `Predicate` containing the supplier or warehouse name will be created and parsed into `updateFilteredSupplierList` or `updateFilteredWarehouseList` method under `Model` class.

    This results in only the display of specified supplier or warehouse in the list.

1. Result display

   An execution success message of `ViewCommand` will be displayed to user. The GUI of supplier or warehouse list will only display the requested supplier or warehouse.

   In the success message, products associated with the specified supplier or warehouse will be shown as well.

#### Why View feature is implemented this way
`view` command contains standardise prefix as with other commands in **CLI-nic** to help user learn usage at a faster rate. In addition, a choice to view by `index` instead of by `name` ensures efficiency since users do not need to key in the full name of supplier or warehouse.

In addition, it was intentional for the success message to display the list of products associated with the supplier or warehouse requested.

This allows **CLI-nic** to be CLI friendly, where users need not click on product pane to display the list of products.

This is further optimised with `find` as users can find by for instance, `name` or `remark` associated to a particular supplier or warehouse. With the filtered supplier or warehouse list displayed, they can view the products associated to a supplier or warehouse by using the `view` feature.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Medical products/supplies**: The items / tools / medicine consumed by patients
* **Supplier**: The companies / entities providing the sources of medical products
* **Warehouse**: The places where the medical supplies are channelled to and kept. The storage condition of these warehouses is managed by the manager, which is our app user
* **Alias**: A user-specified `String` that can be used to represent another `String` (e.g. typing `uw`
    is equivalent to typing `update ct/w` after this command `assignmacro a/uw cs/update ct/w` has been executed)
