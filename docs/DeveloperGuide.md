## 1. **Introduction**

### 1.1. Software overview

StonksBook is a sales-optimised contact management application. It is targeted at salesmen who are seeking an all-in-one application that can empower them to effectively curate their contact list.
StonksBook also provides many tools that can boost one's sales performance through the use of sophisticated data analysis techniques.

### 1.2. Purpose & scope

This document describes the software architecture and software design decisions for the implementation
of StonksBook. The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of StonksBook.

## 3. **Design**

### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

*Fig. 1 - Architecture diagram*
 
The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 2 - Class diagram of the `Logic` component*

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `contact delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

*Fig. 3 - Interactions between components for the `contact delete 1` command*

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 4 - Structure of the `UI` component*

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3. Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 5 - Structure of the `Logic` component*

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("contact delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `contact delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

</div>

### 3.4. Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 7 - Structure of the `Model` component*

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes the following unmodifiable lists that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
    1. `ObservableList<Person>`
    2. `ObservableList<Meeting>`
    3. `ObservableList<Reminder>`
    3. `ObservableList<Sale>`
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)
<br>
*Fig. 8 - Alternative class diagram of the `Model` component*
</div>


### 3.5. Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 9 - Structure of the `Storage` component*

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1. Tags feature \[Wang Luo\]

The tags feature allows the user to add, delete or update tags in StonksBook, as well as categorising contacts and sales using created tags.
Tags are separated into contact tags and sales tags, and they are displayed in alphabetical order.

The feature consists of the following commands:
- `tag add` - Adds a tag to the contact tag list (or sales tag list).
- `tag delete` - Deletes a tag from the contact tag list (or sales tag list), and update the associated contacts (or sales).
- `tag edit` - Edits a contact tag (or sales tag), and update the associated contacts (or sales).
- `tag list` - Displays the contact tag list and sales tag list in the graphical user interface.
- `tag find` - Searches contacts (or sales) based on tags.

#### 4.1.1. Parsing of commands within the `Logic` component

The parsing of commands begins once the `LogicManager` receives and tries to execute the user input.

In order to handle the many commands in our application, we introduced an intermediate layer between `AddressBookParser` and the relevant command parsers, e.g. `AddCommandParser`.
The intermediate layer will first determine which model type the command corresponds to, before dispatching it to the corresponding command parser.
For all tag-related commands, we have the `TagCommandsParser` which serves as the intermediate class.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a tag-related user command:
1. An `AddressBookParser` will check if the command is tag-related. The `AddressBookParser` will then create a `TagCommandsParser`.
2. The `TagCommandsParser` will check what type of command it is and create the corresponding parsers as follows:
    - `tag add` command: `AddCommandParser`
    - `tag delete` command: `DeleteCommandParser`
    - `tag edit` command: `EditCommandParser`
    - `tag list` command: `ListCommandParser`
    - `tag find` command: `FindCommandParser`
3. The respective parsers all implement the `Parser` interface, and the `Parser#parse` method will then be called.
4. Within `Parser#parse`, static methods in `ParserUtil` may be called to parse the arguments.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `execute(tag add <args>)` API call.
- Note that the command is truncated for brevity and `<args>` is used as a placeholder to encapsulate the remaining arguments supplied by the user.
- For example, if the full command was `tag add st/electronics`, then `<args>` is equivalent to `st/electronics`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `tag add <args>` Command](images/TagAddSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 10 - Interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `tag add <args>` command*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `TagCommandsParser` and `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### 4.1.2. Execution of commands within the `Logic` component

After the user input has been parsed into a `Command`, it is executed with `model` passed in as a parameter.

First, relevant methods in `model` are called to retrieve related objects or check for the existence of the tag.
In this case, if the user attempts to add a contact tag, the `hasContactTag(newTag)` method is called to ensure that the `newTag` does not already exists in contact tag list.
Similarly, the `hasSaleTag(newTag)` method is called to check for the existence of the `newTag` in the sales tag list.

Second, objects to be added or edited are created. For `AddCommand`, the new `Tag` object to be added is created.

Next, relevant `model` methods are called to edit the lists of contact (or sales) `Tag` objects. For `AddCommand`, if the user adds a contact tag, `addContactTag` is
 called to add the newly created tag to the `model`, if the user adds a sales tag, `addSaleTag` is called instead to add the newly created tag to `model`.

Lastly, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `AddCommand` that is created from parsing `tag add <args>` is
 executed.

 ![TagExecuteAddSequenceDiagram](images/TagExecuteAddSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 11 - Sequence diagram illustrating the execution of `AddCommand`*

#### 4.1.3. Error handling within the `Logic` component

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of the execution of `tag add <args>`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, errors are thrown at various stages if:
- Incorrect command format is used (e.g. missing/incorrect prefixes)
- Invalid index/values provided (e.g. non-positive and non-integer values are provided as index, non-alphanumeric
 character included in the tag name.)

![The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `tag add <args>` Command](images/TagAddActivityDiagram.png)

*Fig. 12 - The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `tag add <args>` command*

##### 4.1.3.1. Data retrieval

The following sequence diagram shows how the retrieval of contacts (or sales) with tags work.

![TagFindSequenceDiagram](images/TagFindSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 13 - Sequence diagram illustrating the retrieval of contacts (or sales)*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `TagCommandsParser` and `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of executing `tag find <args>`.

![TagFindActivityDiagram](images/TagFindActivityDiagram.png)

*Fig. 14 - Activity diagram illustrating the process of executing `tag find <args>`*

#### 4.1.4. Modelling `Tag`s

Tags are modelled according to the class diagram below.

![Class diagram used to model tags](images/TagClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 15 - Class diagram used to model tags*

We enforce an association between `Sale` and `Tag` to aid data analytics in the `sale breakdown` command.

#### 4.1.5. Design consideration:

##### 4.1.5.1. Aspect: Whether a `Tag` should have a type attribute
* **Alternative 1:** Add a type attribute in `Tag` to indicate whether it is a contact tag or sales tag.
  * Pros:
    * Increased type safety and contact tags and sales tag are separated from each other.
  * Cons:
    * Decreased level of abstraction as contact tags and sales tags are extremely similar.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Type of `Tag` is determined by whether it is in contact tag list or sales tag list.
  * Pros:
    * `Tag` class does not need to know whether it belongs to contacts or sales, improved level of abstraction.
    * Classes interacting with `Tag` via the contact list or sales list.
  * Cons:
    * Will have to implement two tag lists separately.

Alternative 2 is chosen as we found the importance of abstraction and scalability outweighs the additional work in
implementing two independent tag lists.

### 4.2. Meetings feature \[Sebastian Toh Shi Jian\]

The meetings feature allows the user to add, delete, or update meetings in StonksBook.
Meetings are displayed in increasing order based on the start date of the meeting.

The feature consists of the following commands:
- `meeting add` - Adds a meeting to the meeting list.
- `meeting delete` - Deletes a meeting from the meeting list.
- `meeting edit` - Edits a meeting from the meeting list.
- `meeting list` - Displays the list of all meetings in the graphical user interface.

#### 4.2.1. Parsing of commands within the `Logic` component

The parsing of commands begins once the `LogicManager` receives and tries to execute the user input.

In order to handle the many commands in our application, we introduced an intermediate layer between `AddressBookParser` and the relevant command parsers, e.g. `AddCommandParser`.
The intermediate layer will first determine which model type the command corresponds to, before dispatching it to the corresponding command parser.
For all meeting-related commands, we have the `MeetingCommandsParser` which serves as the intermediate class.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a meeting-related user command:
1. An `AddressBookParser` will check if the command is meetings-related. The `AddressBookParser` will then create a `MeetingCommandsParser`.
2. The `MeetingCommandsParser` will check what type of command it is and create the corresponding parsers as follows:
    - `meeting add` command: `AddCommandParser`
    - `meeting delete` command: `DeleteCommandParser`
    - `meeting edit` command: `EditCommandParser`
    - `meeting list` command: `ListCommandParser`
3. The respective parsers all implement the `Parser` interface, and the `Parser#parse` method will then be called.
4. Within `Parser#parse`, static methods in `ParserUtil` may be called to parse the arguments.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `execute(meeting add <args>)` API call.
- Note that the command is truncated for brevity and `<args>` is used as a placeholder to encapsulate the remaining arguments supplied by the user.
- For example, if the full command was `meeting add c/2 m/Lunch with Alice d/2020-10-30 10:10`, then `<args>` is equivalent to `c/2 m/Lunch with Alice d/2020-10-30 10:10`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `meeting add <args>` Command](images/MeetingAddSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 16 - Interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `meeting add <args>` command*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MeetingCommandsParser` and `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### 4.2.2. Execution of commands within the `Logic` component

After the user input has been parsed into a `Command`, it is executed with `model` passed in as a parameter.

First, relevant methods in `model` are called to retrieve related objects or check for the existence of the contact.
In this case, `getSortedPersonList()` is called to retrieve the `id` of the contact that is to be associated with the
meeting and `hasMeeting(newMeeting)` is called to ensure that `newMeeting` to be added does not already exist.

Second, objects to be added or edited are created. For `AddCommand`, the new `Meeting` object to be added is created.

Next, relevant `model` methods are called to edit the lists of `Meeting` objects. For `AddCommand`, `addMeeting` is
 called to add the newly created meeting to the `model`.

Lastly, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `AddCommand` that is created from parsing `meeting add <args>` is
 executed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline
 reaches the end of diagram.
</div> 

#### 4.2.3. Error handling within the `Logic` component

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of the execution of `meeting add <args>`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, errors are thrown at various stages if:
- Incorrect command format is used (e.g. missing/incorrect prefixes)
- Invalid index/values provided (e.g. non-positive and non-integer values are provided as index, non-alphanumeric
 character included in message, unrecognised date formats, etc.)

![The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `meeting add <args>` Command](images/MeetingAddActivityDiagram.png)

*Fig. 18 - The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `meeting add <args>` command* 

#### 4.2.4. Modelling `Meeting`s

Meetings are modelled according to the class diagram below.

![Class diagram used to model meetings](images/MeetingClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 19 - Class diagram used to model meetings* 

`LocalDateTime` and `Duration` are classes from Java's `java.time` package.

We enforce a composition relationship between `Meeting` and its attribute as we do not want `Meeting` to exist when either of its attributes no longer exist.
With that, whenever a `Person` is deleted, all associated `Meeting`s are deleted as well. Similarly, we also enforce that all `Meeting`s must be associated with a non-empty `Message`.

#### 4.2.5. Design consideration:

##### 4.2.5.1. Aspect: Whether it should be necessary to enforce a `message` field in a `Meeting` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Message` class which enforces a non-empty message association to a `Meeting` object.
  * Pros:
    * Easier implementation of meeting commands since every field is necessary.
    * Better data cleanliness.
  * Cons:
    * Have to implement a separate class as well as implement validation of inputs.

* **Alternative 2:** Set the `Meeting` object to be associated to a `String` which acts as the message of a meeting.
  * Pros:
    * No need to implement validation of inputs for this `message` field.
  * Cons:
    * Will need to implement some kind of placeholder text for `Meeting`s without a message when displaying meetings in the user interface.
    * Will have to be more careful in implementation of meeting commands to allow for an optional field.

Alternative 1 is chosen as we found that the importance of enforcing data cleanliness far outweighs the associated
 cost that is required to implement this enforcement.

##### 4.2.5.2. Aspect: What fields should be stored to represent a `Meeting`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store just the start date of a meeting, along with its duration.
  * Pros:
    * More user-friendly since users tend to schedule meetings based on a start date and its duration.
  * Cons:
    * May have slight performance dip since the end date of a meeting may have to be computed repeatedly for display in the user interface.

* **Alternative 2:** Store both start and end date of the meeting.
  * Pros:
    * May have slightly improved performance since there is no need to compute the end date.
  * Cons:
    * User will have to input both start and end date, which can be tedious.

* **Alternative 3:** Store start date, end date, and duration of the meeting.
  * Pros:
    * More user-friendly since users can schedule meetings using just the start date and its duration.
    * More performant since the end date need not be re-computed.
  * Cons:
    * There is the possibility that the three fields may no longer be in sync. Extra emphasis must be taken to ensure that these fields remain synchronised whenever either of these fields changes.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it is the most user-friendly option. It also makes maintaining the data easy.
Because only future meetings are displayed by default, the slight performance dip associated with alternative 1 may
 not actually be an issue as we do not foresee the list of future meetings to be very large.

##### 4.2.5.3. Aspect: How to serialize the start date and duration of a `Meeting`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deserialize them according to ISO-8601 format.
   * Pros:
     * Unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times
     * Easier integration with other date and time libraries should such an integration be necessary.
   * Cons:
     * Should the user decide to open the data file, the ISO-8601 format may not be very familiar or readable. This
      increases the likelihood of corruption of data.

* **Alternative 2:** Serialize them in a format that is human readable. e.g. storing dates in dd-MM-yyyy format and
 durations as an integer representing number of minutes
   * Pros:
     * Should the user decide to open the data file, he can easily understand and make relevant modifications without
      corrupting the data format.
   * Cons:
     * Parsing and deserializing the data may pose some difficulties.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it is a well-established international standard which would facilitate the integration of
 other libraries if necessary.

### 4.3. Reminders feature \[Sebastian Toh Shi Jian\]
The reminders feature allows the user to add, delete, or update reminders in StonksBook.
Reminders are displayed in increasing order based on the scheduled date of the reminder.

The feature consists of the following commands:
- `reminder add` - Adds a reminder to the reminder list.
- `reminder delete` - Delete a reminder from the reminder list.
- `reminder edit` - Edit a reminder from the reminder list.
- `reminder list` - Display the list of all reminders in the user interface.

#### 4.3.1. Parsing of commands within the `Logic` component

The parsing of commands begins once the `LogicManager` receives and tries to execute the user input.

In order to handle the many commands in our application, we introduced an intermediate layer between
 `AddressBookParser` and the relevant command parsers, e.g. `DeleteCommandParser`.
The intermediate layer will first determine which model type the command corresponds to, before dispatching it to the corresponding command parser.
For all reminder-related commands, we have the `ReminderCommandsParser` which serves as the intermediate class.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a reminder-related user command:
1. An `AddressBookParser` will check if the command is reminder-related. The `AddressBookParser` will then create a
 `ReminderCommandsParser`.
2. The `ReminderCommandsParser` will check what type of command it is and create the corresponding parsers as follows:
    - `reminder add` command: `AddCommandParser`
    - `reminder delete` command: `DeleteCommandParser`
    - `reminder edit` command: `EditCommandParser`
    - `reminder list` command: `ListCommandParser`
3. The respective parsers all implement the `Parser` interface, and the `Parser#parse` method will then be called.
4. Within `Parser#parse`, static methods in `ParserUtil` may be called to parse the arguments.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `execute(reminder delete 1)` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `reminder delete 1` Command](images/ReminderDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 20 - Interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `reminder delete 1` command*

 reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### 4.3.2. Execution of commands within the `Logic` component

After the user input has been parsed into a `Command`, it is executed with `model` passed in as a parameter.

First, relevant methods in `model` are called to retrieve related objects or check for the existence of the reminder.
For the case of `DeleteCommand`, `getSortedReminder()` is called to retrieve the list of all reminders
 that are currently displayed in the user interface.

Next, relevant model methods are called to edit the lists of `Reminder`objects. For `DeleteCommand`, `deleteReminder`
is used to delete the reminder corresponding to the specified index.

Lastly, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `DeleteCommand` that is created from parsing `reminder delete 1` is
 executed.

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of the execution of `reminder delete 1`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, errors are thrown at various stages if:
* Incorrect command format is used (e.g. missing/incorrect prefixes)
* Invalid index/values provided (e.g. non-positive and non-integer values are provided as index)

![DeleteReminderActivityDiagram](images/ReminderDeleteActivityDiagram.png)

*Fig. 22 - The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `reminder delete 1` command*

#### 4.3.4. Modelling `Reminder`s

`Reminder` is modelled according to the class diagram below.

![ReminderClassDiagram](images/ReminderClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 23 - Class diagram used to model reminders*

`Reminder` objects are saved within a `UniqueReminderList` stored in `AddressBook`.

We enforce a composition relationship between `Reminder` and its attribute as we do not want `Reminder` to exist when
 either of its attributes no longer exist. With that, whenever a `Person` is deleted, all associated `Reminder`s are
  deleted as well. Similarly, we also enforce that all `Reminder`s must be associated with a non-empty `Message`.

#### 4.3.5. Design consideration:

##### 4.3.5.1. Aspect: Whether it should be necessary to enforce a `message` field in a `Reminder` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Message` class which enforces a non-empty message association to a
 `Reminder` object.
  * Pros:
    * Easier implementation of reminder commands since every field is necessary.
    * Better data cleanliness.
  * Cons:
    * Have to implement a separate class as well as implement validation of inputs.

* **Alternative 2:** Set the `Reminder` object to be associated to a `String` which acts as the message of a reminder.
  * Pros:
    * No need to implement validation of inputs for this `message` field.
  * Cons:
    * Will need to implement some kind of placeholder text for `Reminder`s without a message when displaying
     reminders in the user interface.
    * Will have to be more careful in implementation of reminder commands to allow for an optional field.

A similar consideration was made when implementing [`Meeting`s](#4251-aspect-whether-it-should-be-necessary-to-enforce-a-message-field-in-a-meeting-object).
This further strengthened our choice to go for Alternative 1 given that the cost of having to validate the inputs
 would be spread over multiple features.

##### 4.3.5.2. Aspect: How to serialize the scheduled date of a `Reminder`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deserialize the date according to ISO-8601 format.
   * Pros:
     * Unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times
     * Easier integration with other date and time libraries should such an integration be necessary.
   * Cons:
     * Should the user decide to open the data file, the ISO-8601 format may not be very familiar or readable. This
      increases the likelihood of corruption of data.

* **Alternative 2:** Serialize them in a format that is human readable. e.g. storing dates in dd-MM-yyyy format and
 durations as an integer representing number of minutes
   * Pros:
     * Should the user decide to open the data file, he can easily understand and make relevant modifications without
      corrupting the data format.
   * Cons:
     * Parsing and deserializing the data may pose some difficulties.

A similar consideration was made when implementing [`Meeting`s](#4253-aspect-how-to-serialize-the-start-date-and-duration-of-a-meeting).
Alternative 1 was chosen so as to have a consistent and standardised way of handling date and time handled within our code base.

### 4.4. Sales feature [Kwek Min Yih]

The Sales feature allows users to add and manage Sales made to contacts in StonksBook. 
Sales are displayed in increasing order based on the datetime of purchase of the sale.

This feature consists of the following commands:
* `sale add` â€“ Adds a sale to the sale list.
* `sale delete` â€“ Deletes a sale to the sale list.
* `sale edit` â€“ Edits a sale to the sale list.
* `sale list` â€“ Display the list of all sales in the user interface.
* `sale breakdown` â€“ Displays the number of sales belonging to the top 5 tags.

#### 4.4.1. Parsing of commands within the `Logic` component

The parsing of commands begins once the `LogicManager` receives and tries to execute the user input.

In order to handle the many commands in our application, we introduced an intermediate layer between `AddressBookParser` and the relevant command parsers, e.g. `AddCommandParser`.
The intermediate layer will first determine which model type the command corresponds to, before dispatching it to the corresponding command parser.
For all sale-related commands, we have the `SaleCommandsParser` which serves as the intermediate class.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a sale-related user command:
1. An `AddressBookParser` will check if the command is sale-related. The `AddressBookParser` will then create a `SaleCommandsParser`.
2. The `SaleCommandsParser` will check what type of command it is and create the corresponding parsers if there are any arguments to parse:
    - `sale add` command: `AddCommandParser`
    - `sale delete` command: `DeleteCommandParser`
    - `sale edit` command: `EditCommandParser`
    - `sale list` command: `ListCommandParser`
    - `sale breakdown` command: no parser is created as there are no arguments to parse.
3. The respective parsers all implement the `Parser` interface, and the `Parser#parse` method will then be called.
4. Within the `Parser#parse`, static methods in `ParserUtil` may be called to parse the arguments.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `execute(sale add <args>)` API call.
- Note that the command is truncated for brevity and `<args>` is used as a placeholder to encapsulate the remaining arguments supplied by the user.
- For example, if the full command was `sale add c/4 n/Notebook d/2020-10-30 15:00 p/6.00 q/2 t/stationery`, 
then `<args>` is equivalent to `c/4 n/Notebook d/2020-10-30 15:00 p/6.00 q/2 t/stationery`.

</div>

#### 4.4.2. Execution of commands within the `Logic` component

After command has been parsed into an `AddCommand`, it is executed with `model` passed in as a parameter.

First, relevant methods in `model` are called to retrieve related objects.
In this case, `getSortedPersonList()` is called to retrieve the `id` of the buyer.

Second, the indexes and tags provided are verified by calling `arePersonIndexesValid()` and  `saleTagsExist()` 
in `MassSaleCommandUtil` and `model` respectively. 
`MassSaleCommandUtil` is a utility class used in multiple `Sale` commands that allows for the parsing and handling of multiple
sales and contacts.

Next, all the contact indexes provided are iterated through. For each contact corresponding to the index provided,
a `Sale` object is created. If it is not identified to be a duplicate, it will be added to StonksBook.

Lastly, a relevant `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is created and returned to `LogicManager`.
The message is generated by private methods in `AddCommand`, which call the `listAllSales()` method in `MassSaleCommandUtil`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### 4.4.3. Error handling within the `Logic` component

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of execution of `sale add <args>`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, exceptions are thrown at various stages if:
* Incorrect command format is used (e.g. missing/incorrect prefixes)
* Invalid index/values provided (e.g. alphabetical characters provided for numerical fields such as `Quantity`)

In the occasion that the Sale object provided already exists, an exception is not thrown. 
This is because the `sale add <args>` command has the ability to add sales to multiple contacts.
Throwing an exception would halt the execution of the command, which may cause the other sales specified in the command to not be added.
Instead, sales identified as duplicates are not added to StonksBook, but stored in a list.
This list of duplicate sales is printed to the user along with a corresponding error message.

*Fig. 26 - The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `sale add <args>` command*

#### 4.4.4. Modelling `Sale`s

`Sale` is modelled according to the class diagram below.

![SaleClassDiagram](images/SaleClassDiagram.png)

*Fig. 27 - Class diagram used to model sales*

`Sale` objects are saved within a `UniqueSaleList` stored in `AddressBook`.
There is a composition relationship between `Sale` and its attributes, 
as we want the attributes (e.g. `ItemName`, `UnitPrice`) to exist dependently on the `Sale` object it belongs to.
The attributes are abstracted out into different classes, instead of being stored as values within Sale, 
to allow for greater input validation and attribute specific functionality.

#### 4.4.5. Design consideration:

##### 4.4.5.1. Aspect: How to implement currency related fields
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use BigDecimal to store currency related fields.
  * Pros:
    * Accurate currency calculations are possible.
  * Cons:
    * Need to import the BigDecimal package.

* **Alternative 2:** Use Float variables to store currency variables.
  * Pros:
    * No need to import any packages.
  * Cons:
    * Will likely result in inaccurate currency calculations due to float rounding errors.

* **Alternative 3:** Store dollars and cents independently as integers
  * Pros:
    * Accurate currency calculations are possible.
  * Cons:
    * Cumbersome currency calculations due to converting every hundred cents to dollars.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it was the most appropriate given the size of inputs we wanted to handle, and ensured accuracy.


##### 4.4.5.2. Aspect: How to implement the relationship between Sale and Person
* **Alternative 1:** Store the Person id in the Sale model and storage.
  * Pros:
    * Less storage space needed.
  * Cons:
    * Difficult to retrieve Person attributes without using `Model`.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the Person in model and storage.
  * Pros:
    * Easier to retrieve Person attributes, without any need to use `Model`.
  * Cons:
    * Need to update Sale whenever corresponding Person is updated.
    * Large amount of duplicate data stored in the JSON file
    
* **Alternative 3:** Store the person in model, but store Person id in storage
  * Pros:
    * Easier to retrieve Person attributes, without any need to use `Model`.
    * Less storage space needed.
  * Cons:
    * Need to update Sale whenever corresponding Person is updated.
    
    
Alternative 3 was chosen as it is the most balanced option, reducing duplicate data stored in JSON file and 
making retrieval of Person attributes easier. 
A similar consideration was made when implementing `Meeting` and `Reminder`. 

### 4.5. Archive feature \[Leong Jin Ming\]

The Archive feature allows users to archive contacts who are no longer active.

This feature consists of the following commands:
* `archive add` â€” Adds a contact to the archive.
* `archive list` â€” Lists all contacts in the archive.
* `archive remove` â€” Removes a contact from the archive.

#### 4.5.1. Parsing of commands within the `Logic` component

Much like other core features, we introduced an intermediate layer between the `AddressBookParser` and the archive command parsers, which in this case is the `ArchiveCommandsParser`.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing an archive-related user command:
1. The `AddressBookParser` checks if the user command is archive-related. Then, it creates an `ArchiveCommandsParser`.
1. The `ArchiveCommandsParser` checks what type of command it is and creates the corresponding parsers/commands as follows:
    - `archive add` command: `AddCommandParser`
    - `archive list` command: `ListCommand`
    - `archive remove` command: `RemoveCommandParser`
1. The relevant parser, which implements the `Parser` interface, parses the command via `Parser#parse`.
1. If the user command is valid, the parser creates the corresponding `Command` object for execution.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the Logic component for the `execute("archive add 1")` API call.
![ArchiveAddSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveAddSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 28 - Interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `archive add 1` command*

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommandsParser` and `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### 4.5.2. Execution of commands within the `Logic` component

Since the execution of the `RemoveCommand` is similar to the `AddCommand`, we shall only look at the execution of the latter.

When an `AddCommand` is created by the `AddCommandParser`, it is executed with `model` passed in as the parameter.

Firstly, relevant methods in `model` are called to retrieve related objects or check for the existence of the contact. Here, `getSortedPersonList()` is called to get the list of contacts currently being displayed in the UI.

Secondly, objects to be added or edited are created. In this case, a new `archivedPerson` is created with the `archived` flag set to `true`.

Next, relevant `model` methods are called to edit the list of `Person` objects, with `setPerson()` used to replace an existing Person object.

Finally, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

![ArchiveExecuteAddSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveExecuteAddSequenceDiagram.png)

*Fig. 29 - Sequence diagram illustrating the execution of the `AddCommand`*

#### 4.5.3. Error handling within the `Logic` component

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of execution of `archive add 1`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, errors are thrown at various stages if:

- Incorrect command format is used (i.e. missing index as argument)
- Invalid index is provided
- The incorrect list is being displayed

![ArchiveAddActivityDiagram](images/ArchiveAddActivityDiagram.png)

*Fig. 30 - The different outcomes of the program that can occur from the `archive add 1` command*

#### 4.5.4. Design consideration:

##### 4.5.4.1. Aspect: How to implement the archive
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a flag to the `Person` model to indicate whether the contact is archived.
  * Pros:
    * Less time consuming to implement.
    * Easier to impose restrictions, e.g. cannot add sale to an archived `Person`, etc.
    * Makes use of the filtering of the `FilteredPersonList`.
  * Cons:
    * Distinction between contacts and archived contacts is not clear in the implementation.

* **Alternative 2:** Introduce a list of archived `Person`s to the `AddressBook` model.
  * Pros:
    * Clear distinction between contacts and archived contacts in the implementation.
  * Cons:
    * More time consuming to implement.
    * Needs extra checking to identify archived contacts, which brings us to Alternative 1.

Alternative 1 was chosen to give more flexibility to the implementation and other design considerations (such as whether to archive the sales associated with the `Person`) and also due to time constraints.

### 4.6. Monthly statistics feature [Aaron Seah]

#### 4.6.1. Implementation

The monthly statistics mechanism is facilitated by `MonthlyListMap` and `StatisticsWindow`.
`MonthlyListMap` gets the monthly statistics data and `StatisticsWindow` populates the UI with the data.

The commands `meeting stats` and `sale stats` implement this feature.
This feature will be demonstrated in the context of `meeting stats`.

`MonthlyListMap` has two sets of operations: Data Manipulation and Data Retrieval.

##### 4.6.1.1. Data manipulation
* `MonthlyListMap#addItem(Month month, Year year, T item)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds item of type T to an item list based on the key of month and year.
* `MonthlyListMap#removeItem(Month month, Year year, T item)`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes item of type T from an item list based on the key of month and year if the item exists.
* `MonthlyListMap#clear()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes all entries in the `MonthlyListMap`.

The Data Manipulation operations are used to propagate changes to `MonthlyListMap`
when a meeting command `meeting add`, `meeting delete` or `meeting edit` is executed
to keep the data in the `MonthlyListMap` up to date.

Given below is the class diagram for the Monthly Statistics Feature.

<img src="images/MeetingStatsClassDiagram.png" alt="result for meeting stats class diagram" height="400px">

*Fig. 31 - Class diagram for the Monthly Statistics Feature*

Given below are object diagrams for the Monthly Statistics Feature to illustrate 
how `MonthlyListMap` will be kept up to date after meeting commands `meeting add`, `meeting delete` and `meeting edit` are executed.

*Fig. 35 - Object diagram after editing meeting `m3`*

##### 4.6.1.2. Data retrieval
* `MonthlyListMap#getMultipleMonthCount(Month month, Year year, int numberOfMonths)`â€‰â€”â€‰Gets the item counts for the given month and year and the previous (numberOfMonths - 1) months.
* `MonthlyListMap#getPreviousMonthAndYear(Month month, Year year)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Gets the month and year for the month before the given month and year.

`MonthlyListMap#getMultipleMonthCount(Month month, Year year, int numberOfMonths)` operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as
`Model#getMultipleMonthCount(Month month, Year year, int numberOfMonths)`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the Monthly Statistics Feature works:

*Fig. 41 - Activity diagram summarising what happens when a user executes the `meeting stats` command*

#### 4.6.2. Design consideration:

##### 4.6.2.1. Aspect: Whether to separate `MonthlyListMap` and `UniqueMeetingList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make `MonthlyListMap` a part of `UniqueMeetingList`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and less error-prone as all changes to meeting objects are done by `UniqueMeetingList` methods
   and it is easy to propagate the changes to `MonthListMap` within them.
  * Cons: Might be better object-oriented design to separate the two.

* **Alternative 2:** separate `MonthlyListMap` from `UniqueMeetingList`.
  * Pros: Might be better object-oriented design.
  * Cons: We must ensure that whenever the meeting objects in the `UniqueMeetingList` changes,
   the changes are reflected to the `MonthlyListMap` to keep the data reliable.

##### 4.6.2.2. Aspect: Whether to use month only or month and year to identify a unique month
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use month and year to identify a unique month.
  * Pros: Easy to identify a unique month.
  * Cons: Special care is needed to get the previous month when the current month is January as the year has to be decreased by 1 too. An additional parameter, year, for user to type.

* **Alternative 2:** Use month only.
  * Pros: One less parameter for user to type, easier to implement.
  * Cons: Limits the functionality scope to statistics for the current year only.
