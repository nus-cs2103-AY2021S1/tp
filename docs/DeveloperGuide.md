## **Design**
This section describes the implementation of the design of the app.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">


:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-task 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

Structure of the UI Component for DisplayPanel<br>
![Structure of the UI Component UpcomingSchedule](images/UiClassDiagramUpcomingSchedule.png)<br>
Structure of the UI Component for UpcomingSchedule and below<br>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DisplayPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PlanusParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-task 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the PlaNus data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>`, `ObservableList<Event>` and `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PlaNus`, which `Task` references. This allows `PlaNus` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)


</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the PlaNus data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a lesson

#### Implementation

Adds a lesson to PlaNus via `Lesson` and`LessonCommand`.

A `Lesson`,
* Contains the following attributes:
    - `dayOfTheWeek`
    - `startTime`
    - `endTime`
    - `startDate`
    - `endDate`
* Stores its information in planus.json.

To create a new lesson, PlaNus executes the following steps:

Step 1. After user creates a new lesson by entering the relevant command, the parser parsed the fields and pass the fields to
`LessonCommand`.

Step 2. `LessonCommand` creates a `Lesson` object and calls `Model#addLesson` which will pass the new lesson to `Planus`
to add to PlaNus. `Planus` then calls `lesson#createRecurringTasks` to create all lesson events associated with the new lesson.

Step 3. The created tasks are then added to the `Planus#UniqueTaskList` via the `Planus#addTask` method. Together with the tasks, the calendar is also
updated and the new calendar tasks are added to `Planus#Clendar` via the `Planus#addTaskToCalendar` method. Lastly, the newly added lesson is added to
`Planus#UniqueLessonList` which finishes the state update. 

The following sequence diagram describes what happens when user adds a new `lesson`:

![AddLessonSequenceDiagram](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram.png)

The tasks created using `lesson#createRecurringTasks` are marked as `isLesson` and will not be displayed in the task list.
This is achieved by filtering all tasks with `task#isLesson` set to `true`. The following code snippet is from `Model` class
and shows how the task list is filtered:

```$xslt
Predicate<Task> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS = task -> !(task instanceof Event && task.isLesson());
```

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to store lessons in PlaNus

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save lesson information in a lesson json object.
  * Pros: Saves space as lessons that occur over a long period of time are not stored as many events that contain similar attributes.
  * Cons: PlaNus will be slower on start up as lessons have to be turned into events and added to PlaNus.

* **Alternative 2:** Save lessons as multiple recurring events.
  * Pros: PlaNus will be faster on start up as lessons are already stored as events.
  * Cons: Uses more space by storing more json objects.

### Data analysis feature

#### Implementation

The data analysis feature is facilitated by `Statistics` and `StatisticsData`. 

![StatsClassDiagram](images/StatsClassDiagram.png)

The time taken to complete each task is stored internally in planus.json when the `DoneCommand` is executed.
The `Statistics` class facilitates updating `StatisticsData` from `ObservableList` in UI.

`Statistics` implements the following operations:

* `Statistics#generateStatistics(startDate, endDate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Computes total duration of time spent on all tasks and lessons for the specified time period and stores it in a data structure.

  <br>

The `StatisticsData` class contains the methods to store and retrieve information from the custom data structure. The custom data structure comprises of a HashMap where the **`tag` containing the module code** is the **key** and the **value** is a size two integer array with the **total time spent on `task`** being stored in the first index and the **total time spent on `lesson`** in the second index.

`StatisticsData` implements the following operations to read and update data stored in this custom data structure:

* `StatisticsData#addTag(tag)`â€‰â€”â€‰Stores the module tag in the data structure.

* `StatisticsData#addTaskTime(tag, value)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the time taken for tasks with the specified module tag.

* `StatisticsData#addLessonTime(tag, value)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the time taken for lessons with the specified module tag.

* `StatisticsData#getTotalTime(tag)` â€”â€‰Retrieves total time spent on both lessons and tasks associated with module tag from data structure.

  <br>

The following sequence diagram describes how statistics data is updated when user enters a command.


![StatsDataSequenceDiagram](images/StatsDataSequenceDiagram.png)

When `StatisticsData` retrieves time of each task, it needs to distinguish between a `event` and a `deadline`. For an `event`,
`StatisticsData` calculates the time between its start time and end time and add to the total time, while for a `deadline`,
`StatisticsData` calculates the time used to complete it if it has been completed or skip it if it has not been completed. 
The following activity diagram illustrates the steps:

![TimeAnalysisActivityDiagram](images/TimeAnalysisActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to track time spent on each task or lesson

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Allow user to input how much time he has spent on each deadline  with the `done` command and automatically calculating the time spent on each `event`/`lesson` by assuming the user has spent the amount of time between the start and end time of the `event`/`lesson`.


The user enters the command `done index:duration` where `index` refers to the inedx of the deadline to be marked as done and `duration` refers to the time used to complete the deadline.

  * Pros: 
    * User does not have to key in as many commands as he inputs the time spent on each task when he completed the task. 
    * User does not have to worry about time spent on all `event` and `lesson`.
  * Cons: 
    * User must manually keep track of the time spent on the deadline.
    * User is not able to indicate actual time spent on `event` and `lesson`.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a `start` and `stop` command to indicate when the user is spending time on a `deadline`/`event`/`lesson`, automatically recording the time spent.
  * Pros: User will be able to more accurately track time spent on each `task`/`lesson`.
  * Cons: Keying in multiple `start` and `stop` commands may be tedious for the user.



### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPlanus`. It extends `Planus` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `planusStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPlanus#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current PlaNus state in its history.
* `VersionedPlanus#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous PlaNus state from its history.
* `VersionedPlanus#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone PlaNus state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPlanus()`, `Model#undoPlanus()` and `Model#redoPlanus()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPlanus` will be initialized with the initial PlaNus state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single PlaNus state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete-task 5` command to delete the 5th task in Planus. The `delete-task` command calls `Model#commitPlanus()`, causing the modified state of the PlaNus after the `delete-task 5` command executes to be saved in the `planusStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted PlaNus state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `event title:project â€¦` to add a new event. The `event` command also calls `Model#commitPlanus()`, causing another modified PlaNus state to be saved into the `planusStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPlanus()`, so the PlaNus state will not be saved into the `planusStateList`.


</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the event was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPlanus()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous PlaNus state, and restores the PlaNus to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Planus state, then there are no previous Planus states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPlanus()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.


</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoPlanus()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the PlaNus to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `planusStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest PlaNus state, then there are no undone Planus states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPlanus()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.


</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list-lesson`. Commands that do not modify the PlaNus, such as `list-lesson`, will usually not call `Model#commitPlanus()`, `Model#undoPlanus()` or `Model#redoPlanus()`. Thus, the `planusStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPlanus()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `planusStateList`, all PlaNus states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `event title:project â€¦` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire PlaNus.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-task`, just save the task being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
