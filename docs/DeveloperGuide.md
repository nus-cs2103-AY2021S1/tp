## **1. Introduction**

TrackPad is an app for users to create and store itineraries, to facilitate the planning of their dream vacation!
This document includes the various design choices, architecture and implementation features of TrackPad. This document 
is targeted towards developers who want to contribute to and extend our TrackPad app.


## **2. Setting up, getting started**

Follow the [_link_](SettingUp.md) to set up your environment and get started in creating pull requests for TrackPad. 

<!--Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).-->

## **3. Design**

This section discusses the current design pattern used by TrackPad. It explains the current architecture of TrackPad. 
Then, there is a more in depth explanation on the design of the Ui, model and storage functionality. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.1 Architecture

<span style="display:block;align:center">![Architecture Class Diagram](images/devguideimages/ArchitectureDiagram.png)</span>
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 1. Architecture Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Figure 1 explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/devguideimages/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 2. Class Diagram of the Logic Component</i></sup></div><br>

For example, the `Logic` component (seen from Figure 2 above) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

![Sequence Diagram of the Various Components](images/devguideimages/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 3. Sequence Diagram of the various components</i></sup></div><br>

Figure 3 above shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-attraction 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2 UI

![Structure of the UI Component](images/devguideimages/UiClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 4. Structure of the Ui Component, Ui Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AttractionListPanel`, `ItineraryListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

This design is similar to the Architectural design of TrackPad, whereby different `UiParts` are encapsulated in the `MainWindow java` controller class. This allows the `Logic` to minimise interaction with the `UI`, since the `MainWindow` manages the changes to any `UiPart` classes that result from the execution in the `Logic` component.

### 3.3 Logic

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/devguideimages/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 5. Structure of the Logic Component, Logic Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` in Figure 5 receives the user command.
1. It uses the `TrackPadParser` class to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an attraction).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-attraction 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-attraction 1` Command](images/devguideimages/DeleteAttractionSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 6. Interactions inside the Logic Component for the <code>delete-attraction 1</code> Command</i></sup></div><br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4 Model

![Structure of the Model Component](images/devguideimages/ModelClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 7. Structure of the Model Component, Model Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component shown in Figure 7,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores an `AttractionList` object that is a list of all the attractions in TrackPad.
* stores an `ItineraryList` object that is a list of all the itineraries in TrackPad.
* stores an `ItineraryAttractionList` object that is a list of all the attractions in the current selected itinerary.
* exposes two unmodifiable `ObservableList<Attraction>` and `ObservableList<Itinerary>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TrackPad`, which `Attraction` references. This allows `TrackPad` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Attraction` needing their own `Tag` object.</div><br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/devguideimages/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 8. Structure of an alternative Model Component, Alternative Model Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5 Storage

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/devguideimages/StorageClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 9. Structure of the Storage Component, Storage Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component shown in Figure 9,
* saves `UserPref` objects containing user preferences in json format and read it back.
* saves `AttractionList` objects containing attraction data in json format and read it back.
* saves `ItineraryList` objects containing itinerary data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on the implementation of some core TrackPad features.

### 4.1 Attraction Model

#### 4.1.1 Current Implementation

The `Attraction` class helps users to keep track of all the details of their tourist attractions added in TrackPad.
The class diagram for `Attraction` is shown below:

![Structure of Attraction Component](images/devguideimages/AttractionClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 10. The Attraction Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

Each `Attraction` contains the following fields: `Name`, `Description`, `Address`, `Email`, `Location`, `OpeningHours`,
`Phone`, `PriceRange`, `Rating`, `Visited` and `Tag`. Only `Name` and `Location` are compulsory fields, the rest are all optional.
An attraction can have any number of `Tag`s.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How attractions are determined to be the same as another**

* **Alternative 1:** Compare the `Name`, `Phone` and `Email` of the attractions and 2 attractions
  are the same if all 3 fields are equal.
  * Pros: Do not need to change the implementation which was given to us by AddressBook3.
  * Cons: The fields `Phone` and `Email` are optional, so the basis for comparison is inconsistent as it 
    depends on how many fields are provided for each attraction in TrackPad.

* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Compare the `Name` and `Location` of the attractions and 2 attractions are 
  the same if both fields are equal.
  * Pros: `Name` and `Location` are the only fields which are compulsory, so comparing them will provide
    consistent results as all the attractions in TrackPad have these 2 fields filled up.
  * Cons: `Name` and `Location` are case-sensitive, so comparing attractions with the same name/location with different
    cases will result in the attractions to be determined as different attractions, which might not be ideal.

Reason for choosing Alternative 2: Our team decided to modify the existing code to suit our current implementation
of the fields better, rather than just leaving it as it is.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2 Add Attraction Feature

The add attraction feature allows users to add attractions with the compulsory fields `Name` and `Location`, and 
the optional fields `Description`, `Address`, `Email`, `OpeningHours`, `Phone`, `PriceRange`, `Rating`, `Visited` and `Tag`.

#### 4.2.1 Current Implementation

**Step 1.** The user launches the application.
 
**Step 2.** The user types in `add-attraction n/River Safari l/Singapore a/80 Mandai Lake Rd` to add a new attraction. This attraction does not already exist in the app. 

**Step 3.** `LogicManager` passes the input to `TrackPadParser`, which in turn recognises the input as an `AddAttractionCommand` and passes the input to `AddAttractionCommandParser`. 

**Step 4.** `AddAttractionCommandParser` parses the input and constructs a new `AddAttractionCommand` containing a new `Attraction` with the specified fields.

**Step 5.** `LogicManager` executes the new `AddAttractionCommand`. This calls `Model` to add the new `Attraction` to its `AttractionList`.

**Step 6.** After the new `Attraction` is successfully added, `AddAttractionCommand` returns a `CommandResult` for the Ui to display. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add-attraction` operation works:

![Add Attraction Sequence Diagram](images/devguideimages/AddAttractionSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 11. The sequence diagram of <code>add-attraction</code></i></sup></div><br>

#### 4.2.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How the command word of AddAttractionCommand is derived**

* **Alternative 1:** add-a
  * Pros: Simple and short. The user will spend less time typing this command into the command box.
  * Cons: Less intuitive, and the user will have to remember this specific command everytime he wants to add an attraction.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** add-attraction
  * Pros: More intuitive, so the user is more likely to get the correct command everytime when adding attractions.
  * Cons: The user will have to spend more time typing this command.

Reason for choosing Alternative 2: Given that our target audience are fast typists, a slightly longer word may not
require a longer typing time after the users are used to typing this command in the long run.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.3 Mark Attraction as Visited Feature

The `markVisited-attraction` command allows users to quickly mark attractions as visited, without having to use the `edit-attraction` command.
This command is implemented as it allows users to quickly and conveniently mark the attractions they have visited, so they can focus on visiting other attractions that they have not visited.

#### 4.3.1 Current Implementation

The current implementation allows the users to mark the attraction as visited, based on its index position in the current attraction list.
This index could be different depending whether the whole attraction list is shown, or the filtered attraction list from the `find-attraction` command is currently shown in the GUI.
If the index is invalid or the attraction has already been visited before, an error message will be displayed and there will be no changes to the attraction list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram shows how `markVisited-attraction` works:
![MarkVisitedActivityDiagram](images/devguideimages/MarkVisitedActivityDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 12. The activity diagram of <code>markVisited-attraction</code></i></sup></div><br>

We will use the above activity diagram as shown in Figure 12 to explain how the `markVisited-attraction` command is executed in detail.
We assume no error is encountered, and the attraction that is selected to be marked as visited is not visited yet.

**Step 1.** The user types in `markVisited-attraction 1`.

**Step 2.** `MarkVisitedCommand` is created.

**Step 3.** `MarkVisitedCommand` executes the `getFilteredAttractionList()` and returns `lastShownList`.

**Step 4.** `Model` then executes `get(index)` which creates `Attraction`, which is the original selected attraction in `lastShownList`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 5.** `MarkVisitedCommand` then executes `createMarkVisitedAttraction()`, which creates a new `Attraction` that is identical to the original attraction, except its `Visited` field is set to true.

**Step 6.** `MarkVisitedCommand` then sets the original attraction to the updated one, via `setAttraction()`, and it also updates the state of the model with `updateFilteredAttractionList()`.

**Step 7.** `MarkVisitedCommand` then creates a new `CommandResult`, which contains the success message that is shown to the user when the command is executed successfully.

The whole sequence of events is outlined in the sequence diagram shown below.

![MarkVisitedSequenceDiagram](images/devguideimages/MarkVisitedSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 13. The sequence diagram of <code>markVisited-attraction 1</code></i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.3.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How the attraction is updated**

* **Alternative 1:** Use the `edit-attraction` command to handle marking the attraction as visited, since it can also edit the `Visited` field.
 * Pros: Less new code will need to be written, since we can reuse most of the code from `edit-attraction`.
 * Cons: Functionality of `markVisited-attraction` could change if `edit-attraction` changes functionality in a future update. Excessive coupling.

* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Create a new `markVisited-attraction` command and parser to handle specifically this command.
 * Pros: Less inputs for the user, which makes the command shorter and more convenient.
 * Cons: More lines of code. More test cases required.
 
Reason for choosing alternative 2: Easier to extend to marking several attractions in one command in a future version, by inputting several indexes at once. This would be complicated to 
handle within `edit-attraction` since each attraction could be edited in several fields, and the user input would become unnecessarily complicated.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.4 Itinerary Model

#### 4.4.1 Current Implementation

The `Itinerary` class helps users keep track of the details of their trips and the attractions they want to visit. 
The class diagram for `Itinerary` is shown below:

![ItineraryClassDiagram](images/devguideimages/ItineraryClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 14. The Itinerary Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

Each `Itinerary` contains `Name`, `Description`, `Budget`, `startDate` and `endDate`. Both `startDate` and `endDate` 
are of the `ItineraryDate` class. Additionally, to store the attractions that users want to visit, each `Itinerary` 
contains a list of `Day`s, and each `Day` contains a list of `ItineraryAttraction`s that belong to that day. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.4.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How the location field of `Itinerary` is derived**

* **Alternative 1:** Have a field for location that the user has to manually specify alongside `Name`, `startDate`, `endDate` etc.
  * Pros: Simple and intuitive for the user to specify. 
  * Cons: Would not update accordingly if the user adds attractions that are not in the specified location. 
  It would also get complicated for the user to add and edit multiple locations in a certain order. 

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Get the locations from the current `ItineraryAttraction`s in the `Itinerary`. 
  * Pros: The user neither has to worry about adding, editing and deleting locations, nor making sure they are correct order as 
  it is done automatically. 
  * Cons: The itinerary would not have any specified locations unless the user adds an `ItineraryAttraction`, 
  which might not be intuitive to users. 
  
Reason for choosing Alternative 2: If we were to go with Alternative 1, we would have to provide additional ways for 
users visiting multiple locations to change the order of the locations they are visiting, and possibly provide checks 
to ensure that the locations of attractions that users want to add into an itinerary matches the locations of the itinerary. 
We believe that this would be a more frustrating experience for users. Therefore, we decided on generating locations 
automatically from the itinerary attractions that the users have added to their itineraries instead. 
  
**Aspect: How `ItineraryAttraction`s are stored with their visiting days**

* **Alternative 1:** Have `day visiting` as a field in `ItineraryAttraction`, together with its other fields like `startTime`, `endTime` etc. 
Then, have `Itinerary` directly store the `ItineraryAttraction`s. 
  * Pros: Simple to implement and specify. 
  * Cons: Harder to separate the `ItineraryAttraction`s into the different days. More checks needed to display the correct `ItineraryAttraction`s in the correct days.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Store `ItineraryAttraction`s in separate `Day`s in `Itinerary`, without having a `day visiting` field for `ItineraryAttraction`.
  * Pros: `ItineraryAttraction`s are clearly divided into the different days. Easier to get the `ItineraryAttraction`s on a specific day. 
  * Cons: More methods and classes needed, which complicates things. 
  
Reason for choosing Alternative 2: Since we are creating itineraries that have their contained itinerary attractions 
separated by day, we think that it will be easier to do so if the itinerary attractions are in their respective days. If 
not, any time we need to get itinerary attractions by days, some sorting or checking would be needed. 
  
### 4.5 Add Itinerary Feature

The `add-itinerary` command allows users to add new itineraries into TrackPad. 
To add an `Itinerary`, users must specify the compulsory fields `Name`, `startDate` and `endDate`, and may specify the optional fields `Description` and `Budget`. 

#### 4.5.1 Current Implementation

The `AddItineraryCommand` class handles the execution of `add-itinerary` operations. The `AddItineraryCommandParser` class helps to parse user inputs 
into new `AddItineraryCommand`s for execution.

Itineraries with the same `Name`, `startDate` and `endDate` are considered duplicates, and cannot be added if a duplicate already exists in the app. 
If the user tries to add a duplicate itinerary, a `CommandException` will be thrown, and the user will be reminded that the itinerary already exists in the app. 
Additionally, the `startDate` cannot be after the `endDate`. If the user attempts to add an itinerary with `startDate` after the `endDate`, 
a `ParseException` will be thrown to remind the user of the date constraints. 

The following steps illustrate the successful execution of an `add-itinerary` command: 

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. 

**Step 2.** The user types in `add-itinerary n/Japan Trip sd/12-12-2020 ed/18-12-2020 d/fun in Japan b/1000` to add a new itinerary. This itinerary does not already exist in the app. 

**Step 3.** `LogicManager` passes the input to `TrackPadParser`, which in turn recognises the input as an `AddItineraryCommand` and passes the input to `AddItineraryCommandParser`. 

**Step 4.** `AddItineraryCommandParser` parses the input and constructs a new `AddItineraryCommand` containing a new `Itinerary` with the specified fields.

**Step 5.** `LogicManager` executes the new `AddItineraryCommand`. This calls `Model` to add the new `Itinerary` to its `ItineraryList`.

**Step 6.** After the new `Itinerary` is successfully added, `AddItineraryCommand` returns a `CommandResult` for the Ui to display. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add-itinerary` operation above works:

![AddItinerarySequenceDiagram](images/devguideimages/AddItinerarySequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 15. The sequence diagram of <code>add-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

To summarise, the following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes an `add-itinerary` command, including errors:

![AddItineraryActivityDiagram](images/devguideimages/AddItineraryActivityDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 16. The activity diagram of <code>add-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.5.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to make start and end date compulsory**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Making start and end dates compulsory.
  * Pros: Easier to implement and organise `ItineraryAttraction`s. 
  * Cons: Less flexible for users who do not want to add dates or are unsure of the dates yet. 

* **Alternative 2:** Making start and end dates optional.
  * Pros: More flexible for users who do not want to add dates or are unsure of the dates yet. 
  * Cons: Requires more functionality to handle adding and deleting the dates. For example, both dates must be either present or absent, 

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Start date and end date must come in pairs. Users accidentally adding or deleting only 
one of the dates might be frustrated by repeated error messages. Also, we would need to implement additional functionalities 
to handle how to add attractions with and without dates. For example, we would probably have to handle users adding itinerary 
attractions with specified days to itineraries without a date range, and determine different ways to store and display 
itinerary attractions for itineraries without dates. Therefore, we decided to go with the first alternative for a simplified process. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.6 Edit Itinerary Feature

TrackPad allows users to edit itineraries that have already been added.

Any of the following fields of an itinerary can be edited:
* `Name`
* `startDate`
* `endDate`
* `Description`
* `Budget`

#### 4.6.1 Current Implementation

The `EditItineraryCommand` class handles the execution of edit itinerary operations. The `EditItineraryCommandParser` class helps 
to parse a userâ€™s input before creating the correct `EditItineraryCommand`.

TrackPad uses the `EditItineraryDescriptor` class to facilitate edit operations. 
An `EditItineraryDescriptor` is a temporary bridge that holds the newly-edited fields of an itinerary.

**Step 1.** The user types in `edit-itinerary 1 sd/10-11-2020` to edit the `startDate` of the first itinerary in the `Itineraries` panel.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` passes the input to `TrackPadParser`, which in turn recognises the input as an `EditItineraryCommand` and passes the input to `EditItineraryCommandParser`. 

**Step 3.** `EditItineraryCommandParser` parses the input, constructing a new `EditItineraryDescriptor` object from the input, containing the updated fields of the itinerary.

**Step 4.** `EditItineraryCommandParser` constructs a new `EditCommand` with the `EditItineraryDescriptor` object.

**Step 5.** `LogicManager` executes the `EditItineraryCommand`, creating a new `editedItinerary` object from the fields of the `EditItineraryDescriptor` object and the target itinerary.

**Step 6.** This calls `Model` to replace the target itinerary with the `editedItinerary` object.

**Step 7.** After the target itinerary is replaced, `EditItineraryCommand` returns a `CommandResult` for the Ui to display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit-itinerary` operation works:

![EditItinerarySequenceDiagram](images/devguideimages/EditItinerarySequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 17 The sequence diagram of <code>edit-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `edit-itinerary` command:

![EditItineraryActivityDiagram](images/devguideimages/EditItineraryActivityDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 18 The activity diagram of <code>edit-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

#### 4.6.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Using `edit-itinerary` to edit fields of `Itinerary` only**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `edit-itinerary` is only able to edit the fields of the itinerary
  * Pros: Shorter and simpler `ItineraryAttraction` commands, where the commands only deal with the fields of the `ItineraryAttractions`
  and do not access the fields of `Itinerary`.
  * Cons: Different set of commands to edit the fields of `Itinerary` and `ItineraryCommands`, may not be user friendly.

* **Alternative 2:** `edit-itinerary` is able to edit the fields of the `ItineraryAttractions`
  * Pros: Lesser commands for the user to deal with.
  * Cons: This command could be confusing to users.

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Takes into account users are more likely to use more `ItineraryAttraction` commands compared
to `EditItinerary` commands. It also reduces the complexity of the code in `ItineraryAttractions` by only dealing with the
fields of `ItineraryAttractions` and do not access the fields of `Itinerary`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.7 Find Itinerary Feature

The find itinerary feature allows users to find itineraries using keywords.

#### 4.7.1 Current Implementation

The `FindItineraryCommand` class handles the execution of find itinerary operations. The `FindItineraryCommandParser` class helps 
to parse a userâ€™s input before creating the correct `FindItineraryCommand`.

**Step 1.** The user types in `find-itinerary Korea` to find itineraries with the keyword Korea.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` passes the input to `TrackPadParser`, which in turn recognises the input as an `FindItineraryCommand` and passes the input to `FindItineraryCommandParser`. 

**Step 3.** In `FindItineraryCommandParser`, the string input is extracted as a predicate and used to create a `FindItineraryCommand`.

**Step 4.** This calls `Model` to filter the itineraries list based on the given predicate.

**Step 5.** After the itineraries list is replaced, `FindItineraryCommand` returns a `CommandResult` for the Ui to display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find-itinerary` operation works:

![FindItinerarySequenceDiagram](images/devguideimages/FindItinerarySequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 19 The sequence diagram of <code>find-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `find-itinerary` command:

![EditItineraryActivityDiagram](images/devguideimages/FindItineraryActivityDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 20 The activity diagram of <code>find-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

#### 4.7.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How the command word of `find-itinerary` is derived**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice): `find-itinerary`** 
  * Pros: More intuitive, follows the format of the `find-attraction` command.
  * Cons: More time spent typing the command.

* **Alternative 2: `find-i`** 
  * Pros: Simple and faster to type.
  * Cons: Less intuitive, users might have to remember the correct command when finding their itineraries.

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Given that the find command for attractions is `find-attraction`, 
`find-itinerary` ensures that the command format is consistent and more intuitive to the users.

### 4.8 Select Itinerary Feature

The select itinerary feature allows users to select itineraries before using ItineraryAttraction commands.

#### 4.8.1 Current Implementation

**Step 1.** The user types in `select-itinerary 2` to select the second itinerary in the `Itineraries` panel.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` passes the input to `TrackPadParser`, which in turn recognises the input as an `SelectItineraryCommand` and passes the input to `SelectItineraryCommandParser`. 

**Step 3.** In `SelectItineraryCommandParser`, the string input parsed to an index and used to create a `SelectItineraryCommand`.

**Step 4.** The itinerary corresponding to the index is retrieved in `SelectItineraryCommand` and this calls on `Model` to set the current itinerary 
using the itinerary retrieved.

**Step 5.** After the itinerary is set, `SelectItineraryCommand` returns a `CommandResult` for the Ui to display.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `select-itinerary` operation works:

<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 21 The sequence diagram of <code>select-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `select-itinerary` command:

<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 22 The activity diagram of <code>select-itinerary</code></i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.8.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Having `select-itinerary` as a stand alone command**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use the `select-itinerary` command to set the current itinerary to perform
`ItineraryAttraction` commands.
  * Pros: Shorter and simpler `ItineraryAttraction` commands.
  * Cons: Users are unable to edit multiple itineraries at once without switching the target itinerary.

* **Alternative 2:** Having itinerary attraction commands to specify the target itinerary
  * Pros: Users will be able to edit multiple itineraries at once without switching the target itinerary.
  * Cons: More complexity of code in the `ItineraryAttraction` features having to access both the `Attraction` and
  `Itinerary` lists to look for the target attractions and itineraries. 

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Takes into account users are more likely to use more `ItineraryAttraction` commands
within a single itinerary. It also reduces the complexity of the code in `ItineraryAttraction` features.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.9 Itinerary Attraction Model
This is a subclass of `Attraction` that goes into the `List<Day>` that resides in `Itinerary`. 

#### 4.9.1 Itinerary Attraction Implementation

`ItineraryAttraction` extends `Attraction`. It is a `Attraction` with 2 extra fields, `startTime` and `endTime`. 
It is stored internally as an `List<Day>`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

![Itinerary Attraction Implementation Class Diagram](images/devguideimages/ItineraryAttractionClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 23. The ItineraryAttraction Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

`ItineraryAttraction` is an `Attraction` and contains `startTime` and `endTime`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.9.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Inheritance or composition**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ItineraryAttraction` inherits `Attraction`.
  * Pros: Allows it to be treated as an `Attraction` allowing `ItineraryAttraction` access to getters for `Attraction` without redefining it.
  * Cons: Does not provide reference to original `Attraction`. Changes in original `Attraction` is not reflected in this `ItineraryAttraction`.

* **Alternative 2:** `ItineraryAttraction` would compose `Attraction`
  * Pros: Easy to implement by just adding an `Attraction` field.
  * Cons: Would require many getters to access fields inside `Attraction`.
  
Reasons:
* If we choose composition, we would need to `itineraryAttraction.getAttraction().getField()`.
* If we choose inheritance, we can just do `itineraryAttraction.getField()`.
* We choose inheritance to allow easier access to fields in an `Attraction`.

**Aspect: Constructor**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** constructor takes in an `Attraction`.
  * Pros: It is neater and simpler to use attraction as parameter to create an `ItineraryAttraction` object.
  * Cons: New methods and test cases have to be written to test this behaviour, instead of adapting from `Attraction`.
  
* **Alternative 2:** constructor takes in all the fields of `Attraction`.
  * Pros: Can reuse codes from attractions.
  * Cons: Makes the codes very messy and long.
  
Reason: Alternative 2 will have higher chances of bugs. Attraction objects are currently passed around instead of the 
individual fields, so it simplifies and shortens the codes and reduces likelihood of bugs.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.10 Adding Itinerary Attraction

#### 4.10.1 Adding Itinerary Attraction Implementation
The feature allows users to select an `Attraction` from the attraction list and add it into their selected itinerary, 
with a start and end time.

The following activity diagram shows a simplified add-itinerary-attraction operation:
![AddItineraryAttractionActivityDiagram](images/devguideimages/AddItineraryAttractionActivityDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 24. The activity diagram of <code>add-itinerary-attraction</code></i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Assumes:**
1. The user launches the application.
2. Selected a valid itinerary with more than 1 day.
3. Attractions lists has more than 1 attractions.

**Step 1.** The user types in `add-itinerary-attraction 1 day/1 st/1000 et/1200` to add a new attraction to the selected 
itinerary and the timing does not clash with any exisiting attractions in the itinerary. 

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` passes the input to `TrackPadParser`, which in turn recognises the input as an `AddItineraryattractionCommand` and passes the input to `AddItineraryAttractionCommandParser`. 

**Step 3.** `AddItineraryAttractionCommandParser` parses the input and constructs a new `AddItineraryAttractionCommand` containing a new `ItineraryAttraction` with the specified fields.

**Step 4.** `LogicManager` executes the new `AddItineraryAttractionCommand`. This calls `Model` to add the new `ItineraryAttraction` to the itinerary specified.

**Step 5.** After the new `ItineraryAttraction` is successfully added, `AddItineraryAttractionCommand` returns a `CommandResult` for the Ui to display. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add-itinerary-attraction` operation works:

![AddItineraryAttractionSequenceDiagram](images/devguideimages/AddItineraryAttractionSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 25. The sequence diagram of <code>add-itinerary-attraction 1 day/1 st/1000 et/1200.</code></i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.10.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Command keyword**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `add-itinerary-attraction` is used to execute `AddItineraryAttractionCommand`. 
  * Pros: This command is distinct from the `add-attraction` command, `add-itinerary-attraction`, reduces ambiguity.
  * Cons: It is long command to type and users may be confused with the difference to `add-attraction`.

* **Alternative 2:**  `add-attraction` is used to execute `AddItineraryAttractionCommand`.
  * Pros: This is short and the same as the normal command, users has fewer commands to remember.
  * Cons: This command could be confusing to users and could cause careless users to add commands into the attraction lists instead of the itinerary.
  
Reason: Alternative 2 was not used because TrackPad has no way to know which command the user wants to execute, there is
no way to show the command usage should the user type something wrong. As TrackPad's audience are fast typists, 
these few words makes little difference to execution speed of the commands. Hence, alternative 1 was implemented.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.11 UI Model

#### 4.11.1 Current Implementation

The current UI involves many inherited classes from `AttractionCard`, `ItineraryListCard` and `ItineraryAttractionCard`. 
This is because TrackPad supports optional fields, and with the current code, the `Label` in the FXML files will be created regardless
whether the field is filled or not. Thus, it leaves many empty spaces in the GUI if the user adds an attraction without most of the optional fields.

![UiFXML](images/devguideimages/UiFxml.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 26. The class diagram for one of the child of `AttractionCard`</i></sup></div><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Figure 26 shows an example of the current implementation of the `AttractionCard`. Compulsory fields, such as `name` and `locale`
are present in the parent class since all attractions have those fields. In `AttractionListPanel`, the number of filled fields 
will be determined in the corresponding `Attraction`, via the `getNumOfFilledFields()` method, and the appropriate child will be used to 
create the card. This way, we can avoid any unnecessary gaps found in the boxes due to missing fields.

#### 4.11.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Method of Implementation**

* **Alternative 1:** Only one `AttractionCard` is used to create the attraction cards. 
 * Pros: Lesser code required, and no need for so many children classes.
 * Cons: Empty lines will be seen in the GUI.
 
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Several `AttractionCard` child classes are used to create the corresponding attraction cards. 
 * Pros: Fixes the issue of empty lines being seen, by not creating redundant labels from the different FXML files.
 * Cons: Many classes are created. Some code repetition.
 
Reason for choosing Alternative 2: The final app GUI should look pleasant and attractive to the users. By removing those empty lines, it makes
the interface look more neat and organised. However, this is not yet an ideal solution and a better solution could be looked for 
in the future versions beyond v1.4. A possible combination of the above 2 alternatives could be possible to implement this functionality
with less repetitive code.

## **Appendix G: Effort**

Our project was harder than Address Book Level 3(AB3) because while AB3 deals with one entity, TrackPad deals with several
entities, including Attractions, Itineraries as well as Itinerary Attractions. 

Initially, we had to refactor most of the code to change all instances of Person to Attraction and AddressBook to TrackPad. 
We also had to change the test cases, and since we were still unfamiliar with the many lines of code AB3 had, we had a 
hard time figuring out why some of them failed.

After which, we had to implement Itinerary into the app and make it work similarly enough to Attraction, but still function 
differently from it. We spent much time and effort deciding on how itineraries, and the attractions they contain are supposed 
to work and the fields they should have, which resulted in our current implementations of Itinerary and ItineraryAttraction. 
With the new additions, quite some time was spent on deciding which command words we want to use for each new command, since 
the new commands can sound similar to existing ones. Afterwards, we had to more than double the number of Command classes 
and their parsers to support the new commands, and also add many test cases to ensure their correctness. All of these took out 
a lot of our time and effort in implementing. 

In addition, the Ui had to be able to retrieve itinerary attractions. And this has to be done in a different way from attractions and itineraries,
since there is one global list for attractions and itineraries, but there are multiple lists of itinerary attractions. This mean
time and effort had to be spent in figuring out a new way of sending this information to the UI panels. The itinerary panel also had to 
be able to switch to itinerary attractions panel, and switch back whenever the appropriate command was called, so this was not 
easy to implement too.
