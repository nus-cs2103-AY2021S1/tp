### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four main components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command parser and executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `dels 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.1.1 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
![Structure of the UI Component Further Elaborated](images/UiClassDiagramProfile.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CurrentPanelHeader`, `ResultDisplay`, `CommandBox`, `HelpWindow`, and the various `Panels`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

There are four different possible `Panel` objects :
* `StaffListPanel` : this is where the user can view the list of staffs in the database
* `ApplicantListPanel` : this is where the user can view the list of applicants in the database
* `StaffProfilePanel` : this is where the user can view the profile of a staff in the database
* `ApplicantProfilePanel` : this is where the user can view the profile of an applicant in the database

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Updates `GUISettings` so that lst viewed List Panel can be stored in `preferences.json`, an auto generated and updated file.

### 2.1.2 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `EvaParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a staff).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("dels 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `dels 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStaffCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.1.3 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the staff and applicant data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Staff>` and an `ObservableList<Applicant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `CurrentViewStaff` and `CurrentViewApplicant` that can be 'observed' e.g the UI can be bound to object so that the UI automatically updates when the staff/applicant or it's attributes changes.
* does not depend on any of the other five components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `EvaStorage`, which `Person` references. This allows `EvaStorage` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 2.1.4 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/com/eva/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Eva staff and applicant data in json format and read it back.

### 2.1.5 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `com.eva.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Overview of Staff and Applicants

The class diagram below shows how applicant and staff are related to each other and the various classes they are 
associated to. The following sections will elaborate more on the applicant and staff management systems.
<br>

 <img src="images/ApplicantStaffClassDiagram.png" width="900" />

### 3.2 Staff Management System

Each staff record has the details of name, phone, email, address, leaves, tags, comments. 
The details name, phone, email, address are mandatory.
A staff record also contains `Leave`. More about how this is implemented is elaborated [here](#311-leave-system).

#### 3.2.1 Leave System

The current leave recording system is facilitated by the `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`. The `LogicManager` contains a `ModelManeger` which contains a filtered list of all staffs, `filteredStaffs`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the leave recording system behaves at each step.

Similar to what was mentioned in the [Logic Component](#212-logic-component), the commands related to the leave system,
`addl` and `dell`, are also executed and handled in the same way.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addl 1 l/d/10/10/2020")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/AddLeaveSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 3.2.2 Design consideration:

##### Aspect: adding multiple leaves at once

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** addl can add multiple leaves at once.
  * Pros: Makes it easier on the user to add leaves, not a drastic change from Alternative 2.
  * Cons: Makes the command syntax a little more complicated, makes the implementation more complicated.

* **Alternative 2:** addl should only allow the addition of one leave at once.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Less options for the user.
  
##### Aspect: deleting leaves

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The date the user inputs will delete the entire leave if it falls within the date range of a staff leave.
    * Pros: Standardises the behavior when deleting leaves.
    * Cons: Makes the user enter more commands to change leave information.

* **Alternative 2:** dell will take in a date range and delete all the leave dates between that. If a leave is partially within the range, it truncates the leave instead.
    * Pros: Easier to delete leaves.
    * Cons: May cause the unintentional deletion of leaves.

##### Aspect: leave taken

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Counts up from 0, records the total number of leaves taken.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Counts down from the default leave balance, records the number of leave days left.
    * Pros: Able to easily see how many days of leave each staff has left.
    * Cons: Harder to implement, needs to be paired with a command that sets the default leave.
  
### 3.3. Applicant Management System

Each applicant record has the details of name, phone, email, address, interview date, application status and application. 
The details name, phone, email, address are mandatory. 
<br>
The interview date is wrapped inside a Java
[`optional`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html). 
We have designed it to be as such so that the user can input the interview date at a later time or leave that detail in all cases.
<br>
Application Status is a field that contains one of the `PossibleApplicationStatus` which is an enumeration of all possible application statuses namely,
receieved, processing, accepted, rejected.
<br>
An application also contains a `Application`. More about how this is implemented is elaborated below.

#### 3.3.1 Application Management System:

The application management system consists of the following:
   * Resume parser (found in `AddApplicationCommandParser`)
     * The parser scans a resume text file using a given filepath to detect a given name, as well as experience as education history.
     * Following which, the resume data will be stored as an application inside an applicant under Eva's database.
     * Should the user want to delete an application, the `delapp` command will replace the application with a blank one.
   * Sample resume generator (found in `ResumeTextFileGenerator`)
     * This generator creates a sample resume text file in the data/resume.txt, where the `data` folder is in the same directory as the JAR file.
     * The sample resume highlights the strict format that resume text files will have to follow.
     
### 3.2. Panels (List/Profile) display

Eva currently uses the panel state defined in [GUISettings](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/com/eva/commons/core/GuiSettings.java)
to know which panel state to display.

These are the four possible panel states and the commands that will cause eva to switch to them:
* `STAFF_LIST`: `list s-`, `adds`
* `STAFF_PROFILE`: `view` (on staff list)
* `APPLICANT_LIST`: `list a-`, `adda`
* `APPLICANT_PROFILE`: `view` (on applicant list)

As explained in the [Logic Component](#212-logic-component), these commands go through the `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`
to be parsed and executed. However, the CommandResult returned to `MainWindow.java` lets Eva know that the panel state has changed.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `view 1` API call on a `staff list`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `view 1` Command](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Ui` component for the command `view 1` on a `staff list`.

![Interactions Inside the Ui Component for the `view 1` Command](images/ViewSequenceDiagram1.png)

#### 3.2.2 Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Having different panel states

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate all four panels
  * Pros: Gives users an individual page to view the information they want.
  * Cons: Complicated to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Have all the information on one panel
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Cluttered and unfocused view.

##### Aspect: Storing panel state in GUISettings

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** saves the panel state in GUISettings.
  * Pros: Enables last viewed panel state to persist after app closure.
  * Cons: Complicated to implement

* **Alternative 2:** pass around an object containing the panel state.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Does not allow panel state to persist after app closure.

## **5. Appendix: Requirements**

### 5.1 Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* works in small business/startup (5-30 headcount)
* can type fast
* prefers desktop apps over other types of apps
* prefers typing inputs compared to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Simple and lightweight application that handles HR related administrative tasks, like manage staff performance and recruitment applicants, faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
