## 2. Design

### 2.1. Architecture and High Level Design

The architecture diagram given below shows the high-level design of the software NUStorage.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

*Figure 2.1: Architecture diagram*

NUStorage implements the following design patterns:

* Model-View-Controller (MVC) for UI components, with Observer pattern between Model and View
* Facade pattern for Logic, Model and Storage components
* Command pattern for commands

Given below is a quick overview of each of the components.

#### 2.1.1. Main classes

**`Main`** has two classes: [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/MainApp.java). This component is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

#### 2.1.2. Commons classes

**`Commons`** represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components to support the software.

#### 2.1.3. Core classes

##### 2.1.3.1. UI

**`UI`** contains the user interface elements and is responsible for taking in user inputs and displaying the corresponding results and infomative feedback messages.

##### 2.1.3.2. Logic

**`Logic`** is responsible for executing the commands and ensuring the logic flow of the software.

##### 2.1.3.3. Model

**`Model`** represents a collection of model objects used by the software to hold the data of the application in memory while the app is running.

##### 2.1.3.4. Storage

**`Storage`** is responsible for:

* At app launch: Reading the data files and convert them into their corresponding `model` objects.
* When a command is executed: Converting the `model` objects into their corresponding serializable formats, then store these serializable objects into the data file.

Each of the four components in the **core classes**:

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 2.1.3.4: Class Diagram of Logic Component*

### 2.2. Interactions between Architectural Components

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_inventory 1`.

![Architecture sequence diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 2.2: Sequence diagram for executing the command `delete_inventory 1`*

Section 2.3 elaborates on each of the components in detail.

---

### 2.3. Details of Architectural Components

#### 2.3.1. Commons classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nustorage.commons` package.

Classes in this component:

* Support the overall logic flow of the application.
* Provides utility to be used by other classes.
* Helps with error handling.

---

#### 2.3.2. UI component

This section shows the structure and logic of the `UI` component of NUStorage. It shows a generalised view of the `UI` component within the packages.

Given below is the class diagram of the `UI` component of NUStorage.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiComponent.png)<br>

*Figure 2.3.2: Class Diagram of UI Component*

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/ui/Ui.java)

The UI component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabPane`, `StatusBarFooter` and `HelpWindow`. The `TabPane` holds multiple `Tab` objects such as `Inventory` and `Finance`.

Every component in UI, including the `MainWindow`, inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in the corresponding `.fxml` files with the same name, located in the `src/main/resources/view` directory. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Updates itself with modified data whenever there are changes made by the user.

---

#### 2.3.3. Logic component

This section shows the structure and logic of the `Logic` component of NUStorage. It shows a generalised view of the `Logic` component within the packages.

Given below is the class diagram of the `Logic` component of NUStorage.

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 2.3.3a: Class Diagram of Logic Component*

**API**:
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/logic/Logic.java)

An outline of how a command is processed through `Logic` is as follows:

1. `Logic` uses the `NuStorageParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an inventory record).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_finance 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_finance 1` Command](images/DeleteFinanceSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 2.3.3b: Sequence Diagram of Delete Finance Command*

---

#### 2.3.4. Model component

This section shows the structure and logic of the `Model` component of NUStorage. It shows a generalised view of the `Model` component within the packages.

Given below is the class diagram of the `Model` component.

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 2.3.4: Class Diagram of Model Component*

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* Stores Inventory and financeAccount data.
* Exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<InventoryRecord>` and `ObservableList<FinanceRecord>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* Does __not__ depend on any of the other three components (UI, Logic and Storage).

---

#### 2.3.5. Storage component

This section shows the structure and logic of the `Storage` component of NUStorage. All storage-related classes are stored in the package `nustorage.storage`.

Given below is the class diagram of the `Storage` component.

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 2.3.5a: Class Diagram of Storage Component*

The storage component comprises three different sections:

1. The `UserPrefStorage` section:
   * loads the user preferences and settings on start up.
   * stores the user preferences and settings upon exiting .

2. The `FinanceAccountStorage` section:
   * loads the previously saved finance records on start up.
   * stores new finance records as they are added / logged into the software.

3. The `InventoryStorage` section:
   * loads the previously saved inventory records on start up.
   * stores new inventory records as they are added / logged into the software.

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/storage/Storage.java)

* Saving inventory:

  * Given below is the **activity** diagram for saving the inventory. Saving finance account works similarly.
  The diagram given below shows the decision pathways of the storage component when saving inventory.

      ![Activity Diagram for saving inventory](images/SavingInventoryActivityDiagram.png)<br>

      *Figure 2.3.5b: Activity Diagram for Saving Inventory*

  * The following is the **sequence** diagram for saving the inventory. Saving finance account works similarly.
  The diagram given below shows the function calls between classes when saving inventory.

      ![Sequence Diagram for saving inventory](images/SaveInventorySequenceDiagram.png)<br>

      *Figure 2.3.5c: Sequence Diagram for Saving Inventory*

* Loading finance account:

  * Given below is the **activity** diagram for loading the finance account on start up. Loading inventory works similarly.
  The diagram given below shows the decision pathways of the storage component when loading finance account.

      ![Activity Diagram for loading finance account](images/LoadingFinanceActivityDiagram.png)<br>

      *Figure 2.3.5d: Activity Diagram for Loading Finance*

  * The following is the **sequence** diagram for loading the finance account. Loading inventory works similarly.

## 3. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain key features are implemented as well as their design considerations.

### 3.1. Add/Create Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Add/Create record command feature.
The Finance Records uses the `Add record command` feature while the Inventory Records uses the `Create record command` feature.
As the implementation of adding Finance Records and creating Inventory Records are very similar, this section will focus only on the implementation of the creation of __Inventory Records__.

The Create Inventory command results in an inventory record created in the list.
There are two mandatory fields and one optional field that the user has to fill up.
The mandatory fields are the "Item Description" and "Quantity" parameters, while the optional field is the "Cost" parameter.
If the "COST" field is not filled up by the user, NUStorage automatically assumes the "COST" parameter to be 0.

This is done through the use of the `ParserUtil#parseItemDescription` and `ParserUtil#parseQuantity` methods inside the `nustorage.parser` package, which checks and extracts the item description and quantity (as well as cost if the field is filled) from the command string.

If the compulsory fields are valid, `CreateInventoryRecordCommandParser` creates an `CreateInventoryRecordCommand` object.
The Sequence Diagram below (figure 3.1a) shows how the `CreateInventoryRecordCommand` object is created.

Take a look at the Logic Class Diagram in the [Logic Component](#233-logic-component) section of the DG, where `CreateInventoryRecordCommandParser` is represented as 'XYZCommandParser' in the diagram for a better understanding.

![AddInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram](images/AddInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.1a Sequence Diagram for the Create Inventory command*

The `CreateInventoryRecordCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which then called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`.
Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `CreateInventoryRecordCommand`, `ModelManager` as well as `Storage`, when `CreateInventoryRecordCommand#execute` is called.

![inventoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/AddInventoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.1b Sequence Diagram for `CreateInventoryRecordCommand#execute()`*

As you can see, the Inventory Record, as well as a Finance Record, is added into NUStorage's [Model Component](#234-model-component).
In addition, the updated lists of Inventory Records and Finance Records are saved into the [Storage Component](#235-storage-component) of NUStorage.
At the end of the operation, a `CommandResult` object is returned in which we will use for UI purposes.

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as the created inventory / finance records.
The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI.
This happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called.
Refer to [Figure 3.7](#37-ui-sequence-diagram) at the end of section 3 for the sequence diagram for UI.

With this, the Create Inventory Record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

---

### 3.2. Delete Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Delete Record command feature.
As the implementation of deleting Inventory / Finance Records are similar, this section will focus only on the implementation of the deletion of __Inventory Records__.

The Delete Inventory command results in the specified inventory record, as well as the finance record linked to it, being removed from the application.
This command requires a compulsory field Index to specify which record is to be deleted.

This is done through the use of the `ParserUtil#parseIndex` method inside the `nustorage.parser` package, which checks and extracts the index fields from the command string.

If the index provided is valid, then `DeleteInventoryRecordCommandParser` creates an `DeleteInventoryRecordCommand` object.
The sequence diagram below (figure 3.2a) shows how the `DeleteInventoryRecordCommand` object is created.

Take a look at the Logic Class diagram in the [Logic Component](#233-logic-component) of the DG, where `DeleteInventoryRecordCommandParser` is represented as 'XYZCommandParser' in the diagram for a better understanding.

![DeleteInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.2a Sequence Diagram for the Delete Inventory command*

The `DeleteInventoryRecordCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which then called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`.
Below is another sequence diagram that depicts thef interactions between `LogicManager`, `DeleteInventoryCommand`, `ModelManager` as well as `Storage`, when `DeleteInventoryCommand#execute` is called.

![DeleteInventoryRecordCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteInventoryRecordCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.2b Sequence Diagram for `DeleteInventoryRecordCommand#execute()`*

As you can see, the original Inventory Record, along with the Finance record linked to it, in NUStorage's [Model Component](#234-model-component) has now been deleted.
In addition, the updated list of Inventory and Finance Records are saved into the [Storage Component](#235-storage-component) of NUStorage.
At the end of the operation, a `CommandResult` object is returned in which we will use for UI purposes.

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as the deleted inventory records.
The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI.
This happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called.
Refer to [Figure 3.7](#37-ui-sequence-diagram) at the end of section 3 for the sequence diagram for UI.

With this, the Delete Inventory Record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

---

### 3.3. Edit Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Edit Record command feature.
As the implementation of editing Inventory / Finance Records are similar, this section will focus only on the implementation of the editing of __Finance Records__.
Note that to edit a finance record, the finance record **MUST** be a stand-alone record (i.e not linked to an inventory record).

The Edit Finance command results in the specified finance record being modified.
This command requires a compulsory field Index to specify which record is to be edited.
Furthermore, at least one field in the command must be provided: Amount, Date or Time.

This is done through the use of the `ParserUtil#parseIndex`, `ParserUtil#parseAmount` and `ParserUtil#parseDateTime` methods inside the `nustorage.parser` package, which checks and extracts the Index of the record, the new Amount, Date or Time fields from the command string.

If the index is valid and at least one of the compulsory fields is present, `EditFinanceCommandParser` creates an `EditFinanceCommand` object.
The sequence diagram below (figure 3.3a) shows how the `EditFinanceCommand` object is created.

Take a look at the Logic Class diagram in the [Logic Component](#233-logic-component) of the DG, where `EditFinanceCommandParser` is represented as 'XYZCommandParser' in the diagram for a better understanding.

![EditFinanceSequenceDiagram](images/EditFinanceSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.3a Sequence Diagram for the Edit Finance command*

The `EditFinanceCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which then called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`.
Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `EditFinanceCommand`, `ModelManager` as well as `Storage`, when `EditFinanceCommand#execute` is called.

![EditFinanceCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/EditFinanceCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.3b Sequence Diagram for `EditFinanceCommand#execute()`*

As you can see, the original Finance Record in NUStorage's [Model Component](#234-model-component) has now been updated with the new values.
In addition, the updated list of Finance Records is saved into the [Storage Component](#235-storage-component) of NUStorage.
At the end of the operation, a `CommandResult` object is returned in which we will use for UI purposes.

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as the edited finance records.
The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI.
This happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called.
Refer to [Figure 3.7](#37-ui-sequence-diagram) at the end of section 3 for the sequence diagram for UI.

With this, the Edit Finance Record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

---

### 3.4. Find Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Find Record command feature.
As the implementation of finding Inventory / Finance Records are similar, this section will focus only on the implementation of the finding of __Inventory Records__.

The Find Inventory command searches for inventory records with item descriptions that contain the specified keyword and displays them.
This command requires a compulsory field "Keyword" to specify the records that qualify.

This is done within `FindInventoryRecordCommandParser#parse()`, which checks and extracts the keyword field from the command string.

If there was a keyword provided, then `FindInventoryRecordCommandParser` creates a `FindInventoryRecordCommand` object.
The sequence diagram below (figure 3.4a) shows how the `FindInventoryRecordCommand` object is created.

![Find Inventory Record Diagram](images/FindInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 3.4a Sequence Diagram for the Find Inventory record command*

The `FindInventoryRecordCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which then called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`.
Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `FindInventoryRecordCommand`, `ModelManager` as well as `Storage`, when `FindInventoryRecordCommand#execute` is called.

![Find Inventory Execution](images/FindInventoryRecordCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 3.4b Sequence Diagram for `FindInventoryRecordCommand#execute()`*

As you can see, `ModelManager#updateFilteredInventoryList` is used to apply a predicate to the inventory list stored in `ModelManager`, which changes the inventory records that would be displayed.
At the end of the operation, a `CommandResult` object is returned in which we will use for UI purposes.

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as the inventory records that contained the specified keyword.
The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI.
This happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called. 
Refer to [Figure 3.7](#37-ui-sequence-diagram) at the end of section 3 for the sequence diagram for UI.

With this, the Find Inventory record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

---

### 3.5. List Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the List Records command feature.
As the implementation of listing Inventory / Finance records are very similar, in this section we will only be going through the implementation of the listing of __Inventory Records__.

The List Inventory command results in all stored inventory records to be listed on NUStorage's GUI.
There are no fields to be filled by the user, only the command `list_inventory` is required to carry out and execute the command.

Once `NuStorageParser#parseCommand()` successfully parses a `list_inventory` command, a `ListInventoryCommand` object is created.
This scenario is depicted in the sequence diagram below.

![ListInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram](images/ListInventorySequenceDiagram.png)<br>

*Figure 3.5a Sequence Diagram for List Inventory upon parsing*

The `ListInventoryCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`.
Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `AddInventory` as well as `ModelManager`, when `ListInventoryCommand#execute` is called.

![ListCommandExecuteSequence](images/ListCommandExecuteSequence.png)<br>

*Figure 3.5b Sequence Diagram for `ListInventoryCommand#execute()`*

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as displaying all listed Inventory Records on NUStorage's GUI.
The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI.
All of this happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called. Refer to [Figure 3.7](#37-ui-sequence-diagram) at the end of section 3 for the sequence diagram for UI.

With this, the List Inventory record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

---

### 3.6. Update Inventory Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Update Records command feature, which is exclusive only to Inventory records.

The Update Inventory command results in the updating of a specified inventory record's quantity by a specified change in quantity.
The command has two compulsory fields: the "Index" parameter, which is a non-zero positive integer, as well as a "Change in Quantity" parameter, which is a non-zero integer.
The "Index" parameter indicates the record the user intends to update, and the "Change in Quantity" parameter indicates the change to the previous quantity the user would like to apply.

This is done through the use of the `ParserUtil#parseIndex` and `ParserUtil#parseChangeInQuantity` methods inside the `nustorage.parser` package, which checks and extracts the `INDEX` fields, as well as the `CHANGE_IN_QUANTITY` fields from the command string.

If both the "Index" and "Change in Quantity" parameters parsed are valid, then `UpdateInventoryCommandParser` creates an `UpdateInventoryCommand` object.
The sequence diagram below (figure 3.6a) shows how the `UpdateInventoryRecordCommand` object is created.

![Update Inventory Command Sequence Diagram](images/UpdateInventoryCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 3.6a Sequence diagram for the creation of the UpdateInventoryCommand object*

The `UpdateInventoryCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`.
Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `DeleteInventoryCommand`, `ModelManager` as well as `Storage`, when `DeleteInventoryCommand#execute` is called.

![Update Inventory Command Execution Sequence Diagram](images/UpdateInventoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 3.6b Sequence Diagram for `UpdateInventoryCommand#execute()`*

As you can see, a new Inventory Record with its quantity updated is created which replaces the old Inventory Record.
In addition, a new Finance Record is created to reflect the change in total amount which also replaces the old Finance Record.

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as the deleted inventory records.
The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI.
This happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called. Refer to [Figure 3.7](#37-ui-sequence-diagram) at the end of section 3 for the sequence diagram for UI.

With this, the Update Inventory record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

## 7. Appendix: Proposed Features for Future Implementation

The following documents proposed features for the upcoming iterations of the project.

1. Customizable Commands<br>
   1. We understand that not everybody that uses NUStorage would be comfortable with the current names of commands. Therefore, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to rename the commands to better suit their liking.

2. Graphical Depiction<br>
   1. Currently, NUStorage only displays inventory and finance records as a static listing. We plan to include a new feature that displays the data in a graphical manner.

   2. Expanding on this, we could include a number of graphical options, such as pie charts, bar graphs and line graphs.

3. Saving inventory as items instead of records<br>
   1. Currently, NUStorage saves inventory as records. For business that constantly deals with the same set of items daily, it might seem tiresome to constantly have to add inventory records of the same item.

   2. Thus, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to 'save' a certain inventory item for reuse, allowing them to only have to type the quantity when adding records.
