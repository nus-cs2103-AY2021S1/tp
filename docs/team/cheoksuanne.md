## Project: Common Cents

Common Cents is a desktop money-tracking application to help small business owners to organise their expenses. With Common Cents,
a user can hold monetary information such as expenses and revenue in multiple accounts in which each account represents a business. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features
* **Added the command to calculate net profits in an account.**
  * What it does: Allows the user to view the profits made in an account. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because it allows the user to know if he/she is making profits from the business, 
  which is especially important since our app is targeted at small-business owners.
  * Highlights: This feature complements the existing features to enhance the user experience. The implementation was simple but greatly 
  improves the functionality of the app.
