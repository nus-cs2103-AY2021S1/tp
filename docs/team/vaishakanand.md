## Project: Reeve

Reeve is a desktop companion application for one-on-one private tutors designed to help them better manage their students' academic and administrative needs.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature implemented**: Added the **details** feature to **Reeve**.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add, edit or delete any additional details to a student.
  * Justification: This feature would help tutors significantly as it allows them to add details that have not been
  covered by the other fields, to students. This gives the tutor some flexibility to customise each student as he / she
  sees fit.  

* **New Feature implemented**: Added the **attendance** feature to **Reeve**.
  * What it does: Allows the user to track (add or delete) the attendance of students in lessons.
  * Justification: An attendance tracking feature helps to ease one of a tutor's many required tasks. This is helps them
   by greatly simplifying the process of taking and storing the attendance of the tutor's many students.

* **Other Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added the `Academic` class to restructure `Student`.
  * Added the `ClassTime` and `ClassVenue` that are required fields in `Student`.
  * Adapted the `edit` command to work with the new structure of `Student` in **Reeve**.
