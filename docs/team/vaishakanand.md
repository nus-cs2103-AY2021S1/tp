## Project: Reeve

Reeve is a desktop companion application for one-on-one private tutors designed to help them better manage their students' academic and administrative needs.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature implemented**: Added the **details** feature to **Reeve**.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add, edit or delete any additional details to a student.
  * Justification: This feature would help tutors significantly as it allows them to add details that have not been
  covered by the other fields, to students.

* **New Feature implemented**: Added the **attendance** feature to **Reeve**.
  * What it does: Allows the user to track (add or delete) the attendance of students in lessons.
  * Justification: An attendance tracking feature helps to ease one of a tutor's many required tasks. This is helps them
   by greatly simplifying the process of taking and storing the attendance of the tutor's many students.

* **Other Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added the `Academic` class to restructure `Student`.
  * Added the `ClassTime` and `ClassVenue` that are required fields in `Student`.
  * Adapted the `edit` command to work with the new structure of `Student` in **Reeve**.
