## Project: Calo

Calo is a desktop app that is designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day. 
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Skilled users can carry out various tasks such as adding new exercises and checking records for previous days much faster than the traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&until=2020-11-09&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Liu-2001&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **New Feature**: Added add command (Pull requests [\#31](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/31))
  * What it does: allows the user to add exercises.
  * Justification: This command enables users to record their exercises into Calo.
  * Highlights: When adding an exercise, name and description are compulsory fields, while calories, dates, muscles, and tags are optional fields.

* **New Feature**: Added recall command (Pull requests [\#64](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/64), [\#183](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/183))
  * What it does: allows the user to find the most recent exercise with the specified name.
  * Justification: This command will be helpful if the user wants to add an exercise similar to the one that he added before but cannot remember the details.
  * Highlights: Only exercises that are on or before the current day will be listed. Exercises with future dates will not be recalled.

* **Project management**:
