## Project: Cap 5.0 Buddy

Cap 5.0 Buddy - Cap 5.0 Buddy helps SoC students to keep track of their module details efficiently.
It helps them to centralize key module details and follows their study progress through a CLI that optimizes the management of important module details.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create and add modules into the list.
* What it does: allows the user to store modules into the program with the given information.
* Highlights: This enhancement allows more complicated and advanced commands to be executed with the introduction of the different extensions. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was not very difficult as this is just the basic block for future functions.
* Credits: We refactored the original AB3's code to change from a AddPerson to a AddModule.

* **New Feature**: Added the Scheduler Feature.
* What it does: allows the user to store events into the program to track it in the Calendar.
* Highlights: This feature allows user to match its information with the GUI Calendar.
* Credits: I referred to the original AB3 coding style as inspiration.

* **New Feature**: Added the GUI Calendar Feature.
* What it does: links the EventList to the Calendar.
* Highlights: is able to account for leap years.
* Credits: I referred to an existing calendar fxml for the design. The github I referred to is mingsoon's.

* **New Feature**: Added Tabs window Feature in the GUI.
* What it does: able to switch between different windows in the GUI to see each of the lists.
* Highlights: is able to retain information in each window even after switching to another tab.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI to fit our project design as we needed to display more information. (Pull requests [\#168]('https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/168'), [\#218]('https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/218'))
  * Refactored Ui components to change the GUI display from showing a list of persons to modules. (Pull requests [\#218]('https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/218'))
  * Added and updated tests for the main application, module tracker.
  * Beautified the existing GUI.
