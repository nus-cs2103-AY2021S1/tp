## Project: Bamboo

Bamboo (v1.4) is a **simple desktop app for managing personal finance, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),** and targeted at college students. If you can type fast, Bamboo v1.4 can get your financial management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a graph representing categorical expenses.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view a pie chart which represents the expenses divided into respective tags/categories.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to get a visual representation of the expenses by categories.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires an association class to get the necessary data from the expensebook and initialise a chart for the UI. This feature also requires some fxml and CSS for styling.
  * Credits: *[Referenced code](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/pie-chart.htm)*
