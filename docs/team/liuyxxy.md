## Project: Bagel

Bagel is a desktop flashcard application based off AddressBook - Level 3.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view individual flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to view one flashcard at a time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can focus on only one flashcard at a time, instead of being distracted by the entire list.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to sort the list of flashcards by a given requirement.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to be able to better organise the flashcards they have.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&until=2020-11-09&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=liuyxxy&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)
