## Project: NUStorage

NUStorage is a desktop inventory/finance managing application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

        - Inventory class
        - Inventory Record classes

- Test cases for the above

### Contributions to User Guide

I contributed to the inventory commands for the user guide related to the operations listed above.

### Contributions to Developer Guide

I contributed to the Model section of the developer guide, which documents how `Model` class works with `Inventory` and `FinanceAccount` during the execution of our programme and created the class diagram for `Model` class. I also ensure that all the diagrams in the developer guide are up to date and update them if necessary.

### Contributions to Team Based Task

I helped my teammates with debugging of code and generate ideas on how to improve our code and functionalities.

### Contributions to Other Projects

I helped review bugs for [Team W11-1](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp) as part of the PE dry run. I have reported a total of 15 bugs including some major bugs which will crash the program, and gave some feedback on possible improvements to their UI and functionalities.
