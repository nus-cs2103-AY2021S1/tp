## Project: AddressBook Level 3

Bagel is a desktop flashcard application based off [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).
It is used for studying and memorisation purposes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a list command.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view the entire list of flashcards. Users can also view a list of flashcards belonging to a set by passing the set number as a parameter.
  * Justification: For convenience, the user can view the flashcards of the set they want to look at.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to assign flashcards to a set.
  * What it does: Allows user to add their flashcards to different sets.
  * Justification: The user can better organise the flashcards they currently have.
