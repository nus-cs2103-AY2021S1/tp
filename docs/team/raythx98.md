## Project: CANdidates

CANdidates is a powerful contact management desktop app optimised for job recruiters to manage job applicants.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

### Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `find can`
  * What it does: Searches the candidate list for all candidates with fields containing all the specified keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a typical job recruiter has many candidates to handle, this feature will provide a convenient way for them to look for suitable candidates and streamline their search.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging as it requires chaining of various predicates to achieve the desired outcome. An in-depth understanding of the code base is required it involves numerous other classes.
