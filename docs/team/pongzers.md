## Project: MyMods

MyMod is a desktop mod tracking application used for tracking mods in NUS.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to SU modules.
  * What it does: allows the user to SU a module to not include the module in CAP calculation.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now easily SU modules.
  * Highlights: This command made use of an implementation with data extracted from NUSMods API.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=pongzers&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI to display the semester the user is currently editing (Pull request [\#205](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/205))
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage by 4% (Pull requests [\#276](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/276), [\#281](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/281))
