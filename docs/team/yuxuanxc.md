## Project: TrackPad

TrackPad is a desktop application for planning trips and tracking tourist attractions. The user interacts with it using 
a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Integrated the UI to the app.
  * What it does: Make the graphical user interface more appealing to our users.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the first look of our app can influence the users' decision to use our app or not.
  * Highlights: Work done for this feature includes color and background selection, making borders to have rounded corners and inserting icons for the fields of attractions.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=yuxuanxc&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
