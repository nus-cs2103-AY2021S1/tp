## Project: Eva

Eva is a desktop app for human resource management, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Eva can get your human resource management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**New Feature**:
- Application management system, which consists of a resume parser and generator:
   * Resume parser
     * The parser scans a resume text file using a given filepath to detect a given name, as well as experience as education history.
     * Following which, the resume data will be stored as an application inside an applicant under Eva's database.
     * Should the user want to delete an application, the `delapp` command will replace the application with a blank one.
   * Sample resume generator
     * This generator creates a sample resume text file in the data/resume.txt, where the `data` folder is in the same directory as the JAR file.
     * The sample resume highlights the strict format that resume text files will have to follow.
  - Justification: Resumes are essential for job application. This feature allows HR to effectively store resume data and view them.
  - Highlights: Users can check the data folder for an auto generated sample resume text file. 
- Deleting a staff record
  - What it does: allows user to delete the record of a staff
  - Justification: This feature allows HR to remove staff records that are no longer required.
