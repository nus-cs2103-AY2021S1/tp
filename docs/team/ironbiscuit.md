## Project: NUStorage

NUStorage is a desktop inventory/finance managing application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Below are my contributions to the project.

### Enhancements to existing features

I was responsible for implementing the following features of NUStorage:

* Inventory
  * List Inventory class
  * Update Inventory class
* Added panels to allow for the viewing of inventory records during the preliminary stages of the project.
* Added test cases to improve code coverage.

### Documentation

* I have contributed to the Logic Section of the user guide, adding screen shots of our application as well as explaining in detail the use of the commands as well as how to use them.

* I have contributed to the implementation component of the developer guide, adding detailed explanations as to how our classes interact with each other and including sequence diagrams to aid in these explanations.

* I have added JavaDocs to my code to ensure greater understandability to my code

### Contributions to Team Based Task

* Helped my teammates in debugging, including identifying sources of major bugs.

### Community

* In the recent PE dry run, I have reviewed the application made by [Team W10-3](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp). 
During the evaluation, I reported around eight bugs that I encountered, as well as inaccuracies in their user guide. 

* In addition to the above, I also suggested some improvements to their application in terms of functionality.
