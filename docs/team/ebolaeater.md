## Project: SupperStrikers

SupperStrikers is a food ordering application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added MenuItem and Vendor Class.

  * What it does: Used to represent menu items as items the vendor has in the menu

* **New Feature**: Added Clear Command

  * What it does: Allows users to clear their current supper order.
  * Justification: Helps the user to quickly delete all the items in the order and start afresh.

* **New Feature**: Helped add Vendor Command

  * What it does: Allows users to choose a vendor to order from.
  * Justification: Needed by the user to choose a vendor to order from.
