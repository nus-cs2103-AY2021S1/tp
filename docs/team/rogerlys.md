## Project: KanBug Tracker

### Overview

This portfolio page highlights my contributions to KanBug Tracker - a Software Engineering project developed as part of the module CS2103T during my second year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore. 

### About the Team

We are five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates reading CS2103T: Software Engineering. 

### About the project

KanBug Tracker is a lightweight, easy to use bug management tool that aims to empower developers to keep better track of the bugs in their projects. It provides users not only with a convenient way to record their bugs, but also allows them to better coordinate their efforts between various bugs and track the state of each bug throughout its lifecycle. The team has also developed various other user-centric features to provide our users with the functionality they need to empower their bug tracking efforts. 

## Summary of contributions

* **New Feature**: I implemented the backend logic for the new Kanban View window. In addition, I ensured that commands that depended on the index of the list would work in the new window.

    * What it does: The feature provides a new window provides 4 new column and sort the bug into these columns based on state.

    * Justification: This feature is meant to mimic a Kanban board which was the main idea of the app in the beginning. This would allow the user to have a clearer high level overview of bugs are in the app. Without this feature, the user would only have the window which list all the bugs together. This would make it hard for the user to organise their workflow. This would help the user save time and reduce errors as the app would sort the bugs for them. This would help to improve the productivity and workflow of the user.

* **Code contributed**: You can view my functional code and test code contributions to KanBug Tracker [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=rogerlys&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Other contributions:**
    * **Project management**:
        * As the in charge of code quality, I monitored and ensure that the code written by the team is in accordance with the module. To achieve this I would inform teammates when their code violates any of the coding standard set by the module.
        * Created a jar file and release on github whenever a milestone is reached.
        * Provided alternative implementation ideas for key features.
    
    * **Documentation**:
        * Wrote sections on `add` and `delete` commands in KanBug Tracker's User Guide.
        * Wrote section on new Kanban board window feature in the Developer Guide.
    * **Beyond the team**:
        * Peer testing and Bug reporting for other teams.
