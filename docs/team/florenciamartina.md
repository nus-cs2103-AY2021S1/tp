## Project: FaculType

FaculType is a desktop app for managing faculty members and their modules, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to unassign a contact from modules.
  * What it does: allows the user to unassign a contact from modules specified.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because instructors may retire or assigned to teach another modules. Unassign makes it easier to
  update the assignment.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives because there are a lot of possible command combination. It also required an
  understanding of existing assign feature. Unassign can be used to unassign specified contact from specified modules or unassign the contact from all modules it is
  assigned to, depending on the command format.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to unassign all contacts from all modules.
  * What it does: allows the user to unassign all contacts from all modules in FaculType.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly to ease major changes in the teaching staff structure. It is also used by cclear to delete all
  assignment prior to deleting all contacts to avoid inconsistency or invalid data.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required a rigid implementation because it affects another feature (cclear command) in the FaculType.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add modules.
  * What it does: allows the user to add more modules to FaculType.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because university curriculum is dynamic. Modules might be added or updated to adjust to the
  current curriculum. 
  * Highlights: This feature required an understanding of existing Module, UniqueModuleList, and Model class. It needs a lot of checking to ensure there are no
  duplicate modules or modules with invalid format.
