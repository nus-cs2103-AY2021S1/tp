## Project: Medmoriser

Medmoriser is a desktop app to help medical students organise, memorise and revise their content. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=yongmingyang)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Redefined the Find functionality:
    * What it does: Allows the user to find based on 3 modes
        1. `find t/[tagname]` which allows the user to find QAndA based on the tagname(s).
        2. `find q/[keyword]` which allows the user to find QAndA which contains the specified keyword(s) in the question.
        3. `find [keyword]` which allows the user to find QAndA which contains the specified keyword(s) in the question or the answer.
    * Justification: Gives the user more flexibility to find relevant QAndA sets.
    * Added additional test cases to suit the redefined functionality, increased code coverage by 2.56%: [#58](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/58)
