## Project: FaculType

FaculType is a desktop app for managing faculty members and their modules, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
