## Project: Eva

Eva is a desktop **HR management application** built in the java language. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Eva was developed in semester 1 of AY20/21 as a team project in the NUS SOC module **CS2103T Software Engineering**.
Together with [my team](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w13-1.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html), we morphed the exiting java application
[Address Book (Level 3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) over a period of 7 weeks to what Eva is today.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
