## Project: Lifebook

Lifebook is a desktop task management application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Link Feature**: Added the ability to add a link to a task. (Pull requests [\#86](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/pull/86), [\#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/pull/100))
  * What it does: allows the user to add a meeting link or collaborative link to a task.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because finding Zoom links or Google Drive links can be tedious for the users and the app should provide a convenient way for the users to find the links easily.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the model of the task. The implementation was quite challenging as UI matters must also be taken into consideration.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=kevnw&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
