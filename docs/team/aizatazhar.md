## Project: ZooKeep

ZooKeep is a desktop app for managing animals under a zookeeperâ€™s care, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=aizatazhar&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=zoom&zFR=false&zA=aizatazhar&zR=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&zACS=130.23529411764707&zS=2020-08-14&zFS=aizatazhar&zU=2020-11-04&zMG=false&zFTF=commit&zFGS=groupByRepos)

* **New Feature**: Snapshot feature ([\#124](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/124))
  * What it does: saves a snapshot of the `ZooKeepBook` data at the point in time when the command is executed as a `.json` file
  with the user specified file name.
  * Justification: Zookeepers would need to frequently back up their animal data (e.g. at the end of every
  day) to keep track of the condition of their animals as time passes.
  * Highlights: It creates a separate folder within the `data` directory and ensures that any existing file
  in this directory will not be overridden due to execution of the command.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Morphed `Address` class to `Species` class ([\#60](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/60))
  * Renamed `AddressBook` instances in code to `ZooKeepBook` ([\#90](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/90))
  * Updated the UI ([\#112](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/112))
  * Update help feature to have a clickable URL ([#228](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/228))
