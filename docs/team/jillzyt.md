## Project: FixMyAbs

FixMyAbs is a desktop app for managing exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line InterfaceÂ (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**: Added Exercise model.
  * What it does: It serves as a base to allow the user to create, edit, update and delete exercises.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to create their own exercises which is more user friendly.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing user interface. The user interface has changed to show exercises.
  
* **New Feature**: Added onFocus command suggestion list.
  * What it does: allows the user to view suggestions of the commands base on his/her current input.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may not remember the command
   clearly and the user can refer the suggested commands.
   
* **New Feature**: Added tooltip feature.
     * What it does: allows the user to view information of exercises and logs which are too long to be displayed on
      the screen.
     * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can view the information of
      exercises and logs fully.
