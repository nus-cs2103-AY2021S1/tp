## Project: tCheck

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of the
 (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is optimized
  for CLI users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
