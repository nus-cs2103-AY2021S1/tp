#### Description of Project:

PropertyFree is a real estate management application meant for property agents to organize their properties and meetings more efficiently.
Other application can keep track of meetings and schedules but there are relatively few applications that help track properties 
and associate them with meetings with clients. For our project we hope to make it more streamlined for agents to keep track of their property and have clear information about those properties
and there clients.

#### My Contributions to PropertyFree

* **Add/Edit/List/Delete Bid Feature**: Added the ability to add/edit/list/delete a bid in a list of bids. Pull request: [#76](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/76), [#161](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/161)
  * What it does: Add allows the user to add a bid. Edit allows the user to change parameters in the bid. List allows the user to display the entire bid list. Delete allows the user to remove a bid.
