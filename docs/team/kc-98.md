## Project: Warenager

**Warenager** is an **inventory management application** to help warehouse managers
of small scale companies keep track of stocks in their warehouse.
It **optimizes inventory management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not
exhaustive of **updating, searching and sorting stocks** via Command Line Interface (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contribution**
  * Here is the link to [my code](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=kc-98&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
  on the tP Code Dashboard.
* **Enhancements implemented**
    * **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete existing stock(s) from the inventory.
    (Pull request: [#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/94))
      * What it does: Allows the user to delete the chosen stock(s).
      * Justification: This feature enables the user to delete any unwanted or unused stock, so that
        the storage will not be clogged up with outdated stock.
      * Highlights: Multiple stocks are able to be deleted in one input for faster usage. Status of the deletion will be
        shown to the user, informing them which stocks are being successfully deleted and which are not.
    * **New Feature**: Added the ability to generate a unique serial number for each newly added stock.
     (Pull requests: [#89](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/89),
                     [#92](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/92)) 
      * What it does: Allows the user to perform commands using serial numbers.
      * Justification: This feature eliminates any confusion that can arise when users reuse field attributes when
       adding a new stock. Users can then differentiate field inputs clearly when using Warenager commands.
      * Difficulty: This feature is hard to implement due to the unfamiliarity of Jackson and JSON formats, and the
        deeply abstracted storage classes to replicate. 
    * **New Feature**: Added the ability to display various statistics through a pie chart.
        (Pull requests: [#137](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/137),
                        [#144](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/144))
      * What it does: Allows the user to view relevant statistics for their entire inventory.
      * Justification: Often statistics are needed for inventory evaluation. The quick overview that this feature
        provides will help the user obtain the required data for analysis.
      * Highlights: Statistics are being updated after each command is executed, making it faster to view
        statistics instead of having the input the command lines again.
    * **New Feature**: Added the ability to clear data in Warenager.
        (Pull request: [#213](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/213))
      * What it does: Allows the user to clear all the data in Warenager with one command input.
      * Justification: If the user wants to reset all the data in Warenager, without such a clear command,
        the user have to manually delete every single stock in Warenager. Serial numbers cannot be resetted via
        deleting of stocks too.
