## Project: Calo

Calo is a desktop app that is designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day. 
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Skilled users can carry out various tasks such as adding new exercises and checking records for previous days much faster than the traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=royxuzeng&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&until=2020-11-09&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **New Feature**: Added create command (Pull requests [\#62](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/62))
  * What it does: allows the user to add templates.
  * Justification: This command enables users to add the exercise templates into Calo.
  * Highlights: When adding a template, name and calorie are compulsory fields, while muscles, and tags are optional fields.

* **New Feature**: Added addt command (Pull requests [\#62](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/62))
  * What it does: allows the user to add exercise with the template.
  * Justification: This command will be helpful if the user wants to add the same exercise multiple times.
  * Highlights: Only templates that are in the template list can be used to add new exercise.
