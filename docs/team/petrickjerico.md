#### Overview
**StudyBananas** is a desktop study companion app that helps students centralize all their study tasks and set up focused study sessions into one place, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

**StudyBananas** project was done by a team of 5 software engineering students, where I was tasked with enhancing 
an existing project, [Address Book Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3), morphing it 
into a new product for our Software Engineering project. This page will detail the contributions I have made to the project.

#### Summary of Contributions
This section shows a summary of my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed**: 
Please refer to this [page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=petrickjerico&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&until=2020-11-09&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other) to see a sample of my code.

**Major enhancement**: `FLASHCARD` feature (frontend)

* What it does: The `FLASHCARD` feature comes with a set of commands that allows users to 
add, delete and view the flashcards and the respective flashcard sets they come in.
A flashcard set contains an index, name, and a set of unique flashcards.
A flashcard contains an index, and a unique pair of question and answer.
The code uses defensive programming approach to check that no duplicates are being made, and no null parameters are passed.
Just as the application supports automatic tab redirection for each sidebar selections, the 'FLASHCARD' feature also supports
automatic GUI update of table view whenever a command is entered to list a flashcard set.
  
* Justification: One goal of StudyBananas is to provide an efficient revision method that enhances learning.
The flashcard feature is proven to be one of the most effective revision method, as survey results done up by the team has suggested.
The feature also helps to reduce clutter for users when revising using their computer, reducing the need to open digital files.
