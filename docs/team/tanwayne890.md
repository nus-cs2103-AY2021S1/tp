## Project: Unisave

Unisave is a desktop finance planner app, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `list` feature.
  * What it does: allows the user to list out all the expenses saved in UniSave.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly 
  because a user can see all the expenses saved in the application. 
  If the user uses other commands that change the expense list,
  user can use this command to show again all the expenses that are saved in the application.
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3 `list` feature.
  
* **New Feature**: Added `filter-c` feature.
  * What it does: allows the user to filter expenses that belong to the same category.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly 
  because a user can see what have he spent on a specific category.
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3 `find` feature.
  
* **New Feature**: Added `filter-t` feature.
  * What it does: allows the user to filter expenses that are spent on a specific date.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly 
  because a user can see what have he spent on the specific date. 
  * Highlights: This command need to handle for 2 types of parameters: YYYY-MM-DD and NUMBERDAYSAGO.
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3 `find` feature.
  
* **New Feature**: Added `filter-d` feature.
  * What it does: allows the user to filter expenses under a specific description.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly 
  because a user can see all the expenses that have the same description.
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3 `find` feature.
