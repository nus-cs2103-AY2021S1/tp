## Project: Eva

Eva is a desktop app for human resource management, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Eva can get your human resource management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**

- Load script
    - What it does: Load a JavaScript script to dynamically execute Eva commands.
    - Justification: The script should be written in JavaScript. The JavaScript engine is implemented using Oracle Nashorn. Only ES5 syntax is supported.
    - Highlights: Allow users to have full control of Eva and add the features they want.
- Find applicant and staff records
    - What it does: Find the records of applicants or staff by names
    - Justification: The command will bring the user to corresponding GUI panel, saving the time for switching.
