## Project: PIVOT (Police Investigation Virtual Organisational Tool)
PIVOT is a desktop application to assist the police investigators in keeping track of their investigations and relevant information. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo and redo previous commands. (Pull Request [\#157](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/157))
  * What it does: Allows the user to undo all previous commands that make changes to the PIVOT data one at a time.
    Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the quality of the product significantly as it gives users a better user experience by providing a convenient way
    to easily rectify any mistakes in commands.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. The implementation was challenging as it required
    changes to existing commands. It also required consideration of the behaviour of undo and redo when a case was open, as undo/redo may change the
    list of cases in the main page, hence affecting the index of the case that was currently open.
  * Credits: Referenced the proposed implementation for undo/redo in the AB3 developer guide.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete a suspect from a case. (Pull Request [\#130](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/130))
  * What it does: Allows the user to add and delete a suspect into a specified case one at a time.
  * Justification: This feature is highly pertinent as our application aims to help users better manage relevant information about investigations.
    With the feature, users are able to keep track of the list of suspects of a case, with all its relevant details.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit the fields of suspects/witnesses/victims in a specified case. (Pull Request [\#167](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/167))
  * What it does: Allows the user to be able to edit multiple fields of a suspect/witness/victim at one time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product greatly as it provides a convenient way of rectifying a mistake made in one of the fields,
    without having delete the person and create a new person by re-entering all the existing fields. 
  * Highlights: The implementation of this enhancement was challenging as there was much common code in implementing the edit command for the persons, thus
    requiring rigorous brainstorming in reducing the duplicated code.
  * Credits: Took inspiration from AB3 implementation of the edit command to abstract out the common code.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=esmanda3w&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Took down minutes for meeting discussions on what to do for the next iteration
  * Facilitated the allocation of work among group members
  
* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored the code base from working on `Person` to `Case` (Pull Request [\#105](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/105))
  * Refactored the code base from working on `AddressBook` to `Pivot` (Pull Request [\#141](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/141))
  * Abstract out AddCommand to be an abstract parent class for future add commands (Pull Request [\#118](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/118))
  * Abstracted out common code in test cases (Pull Requests [\#229](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/229))
  * Increase defensiveness of code by returning defensive copies of `Case` fields (Pull Request [\#239](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/239))
  
* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `undo`, `redo` (Pull Request [\#171](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/171))
    * Updated documentation for the `edit` feature to include editing of the fields of suspects/witnesses/victims in a specified case (Pull Request [\#171](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/171))
  * Developer Guide:
    * Modified proposed implementation for Undo/Redo commands to be aligned with current implementation (Pull Request [\#171](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/171))

* **Community**:
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class during [PE-Dry Run](https://github.com/esmanda3w/ped/issues)
