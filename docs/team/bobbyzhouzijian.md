## Introduction

This page serves to document my contributions to the project PlaNus under NUS module CS2103T in AY20/21 semester 1. 

## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a **task managing desktop application** for students in NUS with many projects and deadlines, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is now simple and quick!


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: Added the ability to find tasks and lessons.
  * What it does: easy-to-use CLI commands to find a particular task or lesson according to a set of specified attributes.
  * Justifications: The `find-task` and `find-lesson` features are integral in managing a large amount of tasks and lessons.
  * Highlights: This feature requires deep integration with other features because the there are many attributes that a task/lesson
  can be searched for. Also, it requires rigorous analysis in deciding what specific attributes should be included in the search feature
  so as to allow users find what they want with ease. Lastly, since many attributes are involved, prudence is required in implementing the feature
  to ensure that different combinations of attributes do not result in a bug.

* **New Features**: Added the ability to edit and delete a lesson.
  * What it does: allows user to edit or delete a lesson by a set of attributes. The calendar and data analysis will be updated as well.
  * Justifications: The ability to edit or delete a lesson is important in managing lessons. Users need to use this feature frequently to edit a lesson under
  many situations, for example the user makes a typo in the lesson title or the lesson is not relevant anymore.
  * Highlights: This feature requires a meticulous and creative design to ensure that the edited lesson is reflected on the calendar view
  as well as the data analysis as well. Also, it needs to integrate well with the `Overlap` class implemented by my teammate Marcus to
  ensure that edited lessons do not overlap with other time slots already existing in PlaNus. 

* **New Features**: Adds the ability to save lessons in JSON.
  * What it does: Allows lessons to be saved locally to a JSON.
  * Justifications: Similar to tasks, it is important that the lessons that a user adds to PlaNus is properly saved and can be referred next time
  PlaNus runs. The lessons saved should not take too much space of the JSON file. Also, PlaNus should be able to read all the relevant lesson events
  from the saved lessons when starting.
  * Highlights: As lesson is essentially a set of recurring tasks, a naive solution is to simply save all the recurring tasks to the JSON. However,
  this can results in too much data being saved locally and make PlaNus app too large, which contravenes with the objective of making PlaNus lightweight. So 
  instead of saving all recurring tasks, I decided to save only the lesson information and reconstruct all the recurring tasks based on the lessons read from
  the JSON file every time PlaNus runs.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed the milestones `v1.2`, `v1.3` and `v1.4` (including related issues and deadlines) on GitHub. 

* **Code contributed**: 
  * My code contributions to PlaNus can be found via the [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=bobbyzhouzijian&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other).

* **Enhancement to existing features**:
  * Added test cases to many existing features and classes [\#274](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/274)
  * Refactored code to improve code quality such as abstracting out repeated codes in the parsers and commands [\#270](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/270), [\#267](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/267)
  * Redesign the `help` feature to display a much more user-friendly help window instead of just a 
  URL to the user guide implemented by the original ab3. The new help window now includes a summary view of all the commands in PlaNus.
  Users do not have to navigate to the user guide to look up for all the commands. [\#200](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/200)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added hyperlinks to Table of Content [\#74](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/74)
    * Added documentation to the `lesson`, `edit-lesson`, `find-lesson` and `delete-lesson` commands [\#186](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/186)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated NFRs and Glossaries [\#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/94)
    * Updated documentation for the `Appendix:Requirements` section [\#246](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/246)
    * Added several UML diagrams to better illustrate the new features implemented, including:
      * `AddLessonSequenceDiagram`
      * `StatsClassDiagram`
      * `StatsDataSequenceDiagram`
      * `TimeAnalysisAcvitityDiagram`
      * Refer to [\#275](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/275) for more details 
    * Refactored existing UML diagrams in the `Implementation` section from ab3 to fit the design of PlaNus [\#275](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/275)
