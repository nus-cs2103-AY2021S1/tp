## Project: NUStorage

NUStorage is a desktop inventory/finance managing application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Code Contributed

You can view my contributions [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=howtoosee).

### Enhancements Implemented

I was responsible for implementing the following features of NUStorage:

- Storage
  - Serializable Inventory Storage classes
  - Json Adapted Inventory Record classes
  - Serializable Finance Storage classes
  - Json Adapted Finance Record classes
  - Storage Manager classes
- Testing for the above components

### Contributions to User Guide

I contributed to the UG's sections on commands and command summary, as well as the quick start guide and FAQs.

### Contributions to Developer Guide

I contributed to the storage sections of the developer's guide, which documents the logic flow of reading and saving data to and from the stroage file in `.json` data format.

I also created class diagrams and sequence diagrams for the storage components to visualise relationship between storage classes, logic and dataflow between these classes.

### Contributions to Team Based Task

I helped my teammates in architectural design and debugging of code. I was also in charge of many administrative tasks.

### Contributions to Other Projects

I helped to find bugs for [Team W17-1](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp) as part of the PE dry run, during which I found and reported more than 15 errors and gave multiple suggestions regarding design and documentation.
