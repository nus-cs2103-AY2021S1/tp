## Project: NUStorage

NUStorage is a desktop inventory/finance managing application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
