## Project: CliniCal

CliniCal is a desktop app that allows doctors to manage patient records and schedule upcoming appointments.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add/delete appointment for existing patients
  * What it does: Added the ability to add and delete appointments.
  * Justification: Allows user to add and delete appointments for existing patients.
  * Highlights: The add appointment command is made simple to use as all you need to provide is the patient index, appointment's start date, time and duration. 
  Based on the provided patient index, the command will retrieve the patient's name and IC. It will also generate the appointment's end date and time automatically based on the provided duration.
  * Credits: NIL

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
  * What it does: Added the ability to allow user to reuse previous commands without the need to retype it again.
  * Justification: Allows user to easily see and make use of previous commands.
  * Highlights: Highly user-centric and is extremely convenient and common to use. A lot of my peers who tested our application really liked this feature.
