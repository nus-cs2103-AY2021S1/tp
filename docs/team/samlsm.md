## Project: Tutor's Pet

## Overview
Tutor's Pet is a **desktop application for managing students and classes**, designed for teaching assistants in NUS
School of Computing.

Tutor's Pet is morphed from an existing desktop Java application
[Address Book (Level 3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) and several enhancements was made to it by my
team of 5 NUS Computer Science students over a period of 6 weeks.

The following sections document all the contributions that I have made to Tutor's Pet.

## Summary of Contributions
Here is a summary of my personal contributions to the team project. All my code contributions can be found
[here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=samlsm).

### Major Enhancements:
* Designed a new UI for tutors pet. [#108](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/108)
  * What it does: Display all information that a user would require in a clear and concise format.
  * Justification: The change in design was essential for Tutor's Pet because the original address book design was
    unable to meet the needs of Tutor's Pet. With the new design, users are able to see the classes and students they
    have immediately. With certain commands, they would also be able to filter the student list and see only students
    in a specific class.
  * Highlights: Designing the UI for Tutor's Pet was challenging because there was a lot of information we wanted to
    present in that small window without the UI looking too cluttered. Hence, it was necessary to do a deeper
    analysis to prioritise the importance of different information before deciding and coming up with a design.

* Introduced `stats` command. [#184](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/184)
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to see the overall performance of a student in a class. It computes the
    student's average participation score and attendance for the entire semester.
  * Justification: This feature is important because it allows users to see the overall performance of a student
    without the hassle of having to compute it themselves. It satisfies one of Tutor's Pet goals which
    is to help tutors track a student's progress over time.
  * Highlights: Implementation of this enhancement was challenging because the direct implementation of it would
    break the law of demeter. Hence a more in-depth analysis of its implementations was necessary.

### Minor Enhancements:
* Some of the notable commands added:
  * `edit-class` command: Edit the details of a class. [#63](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/63)
  * `find-class` command: Find classes which contains the specified keyword(s).
    [#92](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/92)
  * `delete-lesson` command: Delete a lesson and all its relevant data.
    [#124](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/124)
  * `add-attendance` command: Record the attendance of a specific student for a specific week's lesson.
    [#142](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/142)
  * `display-venue` command: Obtains the venue of a specific lesson from the command result box. It was
    implemented because we notice that users are unable to copy venues directly from the displayed class list.
    [#166](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/166)

* Fix help window bug. [#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/94)
  * Address a bug that results in help window not appearing when minimised.

* Fix UI scaling. [#126](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/126)
  * Address a bug that results in UI not scaling equally when the window is being resized.

* Renamed base package. [#165](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/165)
  * Renamed the base package from `seedu.address` to `tutorspet`.
