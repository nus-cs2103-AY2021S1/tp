## Project: Calo

Calo is a desktop app that is designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI).

We built Calo upon the [Address Book Level 3 (AB3) project](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to update a `Exercise` record.
  * What it does: Allow the user to edit the `Exercise` at the specified `INDEX`. For more details, please refer to the [User Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#33-update-exercises--update).
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can update the `Exercise` record (eg. when he has made a mistake in adding an `Exercise` entry). The app should provide a convenient way to do so.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is a refactor of the existing `edit` commands in AB3. It required an in-depth analysis of the initial codebase, architecture and design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required changes throughout the stack: front-end to display the updated `Exercise` record, and back-end to evaluate the different fields in `Exercise`).

* **New Feature**: Added a `help` command that displays a link to the user guide.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to conveniently access all available commands with a simple command.

* **New Feature**: Added an `exit` command that allows the user to exit the app.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to exit the app using a simple command, without having to point the mouse to the close button.

* **New Feature**: Added an `clear` command that allows the user to clear all existing `Exercise` entries.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to reset his logs using a simple command.
