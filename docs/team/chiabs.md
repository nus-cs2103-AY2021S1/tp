## Project: Hospify

Hospify is an application to help maintain medical records.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to check number of patients in record. (Pull request [\#34](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/34))
  * What it does: allows the user to find total number of recorded patients.
  * Justification: This feature provides a convenient way to check total patients.
  * Highlights: The implementation requires a new class to be created and amendments
    to a few pre-existing classes.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort the patients in record by name and NRIC. (Pull request [\#106](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/106))
  * What it does: allows the user to sort in ascending order by name/NRIC.
  * Justification: This feature provides a convenient way to sort through patients.
  * Highlights: This implementation requires several new classes to be created and amendments
    to a few pre-existing classes.
