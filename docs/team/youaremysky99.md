## Project: FixMyAbs

FixMyAbs is a command line interface application that helps manage workouts, written in Java and can run smoothly in 
any environment

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Refactor**: Refactored many commands of previous Addressbook to new FixMyAbs commands
  * What it does: Helps changing functionalities of old Addressbook commands to fit into our new use cases and deal
  with logs and exercises.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability Edit exercises in the system. 
  * What it does: It helps user to edit an exercise in the app, with new calories per rep or new name.
  * Justification: Sometimes, user can make mistakes when creating exercises, or when there is a change in how effective 
  an exercise helps in reducing calories. Hence it is a need for the app to allow 
  the ability to edit the current exercises' information. 
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it needs to accept many optional fields.
