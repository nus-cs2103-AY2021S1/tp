## Project: Ace CS2103/T

Ace CS2103/T is a desktop task manager application used for keeping track of tasks for CS2103/T Software Engineering. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

    * What it does: Understand user input and give command to logic manager.
