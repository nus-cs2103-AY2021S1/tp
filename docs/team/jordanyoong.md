## Project: Common Cents

Common Cents is a desktop money-tracking application to help small business owners to organise their expenses. With Common Cents,
a user can hold monetary information such as expenses and revenue in multiple accounts in which each account represents a business. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features

* **Added and wrote tests for the command to exit application.**
  * What it does: Allows the user to exit the application. 
  * Justification: This feature is foundational, and allows the user to exit the application once they're done with their tasks.
  * Highlights: This feature forms part of the base for the user experience. Implementation was necessary for application
  to be usable.
  * Related Pull Request: [\#54](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/54)

* **Added and wrote tests for the command to delete entries from an account.**
  * What it does: Allows the user to remove entries from an account. 
  * Justification: This feature is one of the foundations of the product, allowing users to remove entries from an account.
  * Highlights: This feature forms part of the base for the user experience. Implementation was necessary for application
  to be usable.
  * Related Pull Request: [\#59](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/59)
  
* **Added and wrote tests for the command to clear entries from an account.**
  * What it does: Allows the user to clear a category/all entries from an account. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing user to mass delete entries depending on the need.
  * Highlights: This feature enhances user experience by making the workflow more efficient. Implementation required some
  refactoring through the levels but was not too complicated.
