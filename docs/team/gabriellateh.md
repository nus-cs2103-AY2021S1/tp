## Introduction

This page serves to document my contributions to the project PlaNus under NUS module CS2103T in AY20/21 semester 1. 
<br>

## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a desktop application for **managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, PlaNus can get your tasks managed faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Project management**: Update the README and website pages.
  * Update the README and website markdowns to be consistent with our project
  * Managed releases `v1.2, v1.3, v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub
  
* **Features added**: Added the ability to add events and lessons to the calendar
  * What it does: This feature allows for events and lessons to be added to a list when the user adds in new events and lessons. This list is used to show the events and lessons on the calendar view.
  * Justification: This feature is integral as it works with the calendar view UI.

* **Code contributed**:
