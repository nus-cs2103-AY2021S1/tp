## Project: Jarvis

Jarvis is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers) to help Avengers keep track of their grading duties and consultations.
The user interacts with it using CLI and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has more than 10kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view deadlines for current Missions and Quests
  * What it does: Lists all the current ongoing Missions and Quests with their deadlines.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to keep track of the deadlines of Missions and Quests so that they know
  when they can start marking, and adjust their workload accordingly.
  * Highlights: This is a core feature for our app as it serves as a reminder for Avengers on their upcoming marking tasks
  so that they can manage their time.
  * Credits: *Selenium WebDriver for the ability to scrape for information on Source Academy*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view ungraded Missions and Quests
  * What it does: List all the ungraded Missions and Quests that the Avenger has yet to mark.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to keep track of the Missions and Quests that they have yet to mark so
  that they know specifically which Missions and Quests they have to mark.
  * Highlights: This is another core feature for our app as it serves as a reminder for Avengers on which Missions and Quests
  they have to mark so that they can manage their time.
  * Credits: *Selenium WebDriver for the ability to scrape for information on Source Academy*
