## Project: TR4CKER

TR4CKER is a desktop app that helps SoC students track their tasks, meet their deadlines, and stay productive. It is
optimized for Computing students familiar with CLI, who can manage their tasks efficiently by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=cwenling)

* **Morphing of AddressBook:**
  * Refactor Phone class to Deadline class: [\#19](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/19)

* **New Feature**: Started done command feature.
  * What it does: Allows users to update the completion status of a task in percentage.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to update the completion status of a task using a more intuitive command
  \(`done`) instead of updating it using the Edit feature.
  * Highlights: This new feature allows users to either increase or decrease the completion status of a task, which
  makes it flexible for users to use as they may realise that the task has more to do than they first realised.

* **New Feature**: Added countdown tab.
  * What it does: Allows users to view their upcoming events as a list of countdowns in a separate tab.
  * Justification: This feature provides users with the flexibility of adding a separate type of thing to track,
  namely an `event`, which does not fit the mold of a `task`. This feature is a one-stop insight into the upcoming events
  that the user has, including Examinations, and other important dates such as holidays, in order to serve as a
  reminder for how much time they have left.
  * Highlights: This new feature tells the user how many days there are, until a particular event, rather than just
  showing the date of an event's occurrence. Users are able to add a new event, or delete an event, without affecting
  their tasks list. The list of events automatically sorts whenever a new event is added or deleted or upon
  starting the application. Users are also able to query the number of events they have in a specified number of days
  from now.

* **Enhancements**:
  * Updated GUI to include the mascot and tasklist header: [\#83](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/83)

  * Update tab menu of GUI to have more consistent naming: [\#174](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/174)
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 56.16% to 59.86%: [\#175](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/175)
