## Project: Inventory Book (OneShelf)

OneShelf is an app designed to automate the managing of stock inventory for business owners which translates to savings in man-hours and minimal losses due to over stocking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Wincenttjoi&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=functional-code~test-code)


* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1`, `v1.2`, `v1.2b`, `v1.3` on GitHub

* **Added help and preview window**: Help window and summary command window.
  * What it does: Allows users to have easy reference when they want to start learning OneShelf.
  * Justification: As OneShelf have a relatively steep learning curve, it is good to have a good guidance at the
  start to ensure that user can get accustomed to the features easily.
  * (Pull Request [#80](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/80),
  [#81](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/81), [#90](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/90))

* **Added dynamic clock**: Allows user to see clock instead of storage on bottom left corner of application.
  * What it does: Shows users a more useful information (current date time).
  * Justification: A restaurant manager would be more concerned with current time and date rather than the storage data location.
  * (Pull Request [#143](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/143))

* **Added delivery commands**: Allows user to input commands for delivery, specifically are: `list-d`, `clear-d`, `delete-d` and `edit-d`.
  * What it does: Allows delivery features to work for users.
  * Justification: A restaurant manager would want to be able to list, clear, delete and edit deliveries.
