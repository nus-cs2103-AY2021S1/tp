## Project: SupperStrikers

SupperStrikers is a food ordering application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display and switch between vendors. (Pull requests [#78](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/pull/78), [#86](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/pull/86))

  * What it does: Allows the user to select a vendor to order from. When a vendor has been successfully selected, the GUI portion will display the menu of the selected vendor.
  * Justification: This feature is required to allow users to select a vendor so that they are able to view the menu corresponding to that vendor.
  * Highlights: This enhancement creates a new vendor mode for SupperStrikers, where the menu based commands will return an error message in vendor mode. Corresponding commands such as VendorCommand and SwitchVendorCommand are implemented to switch between vendor mode and menu mode.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display the menu of the selected vendor in menu mode. (Pull requests [#78](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/pull/78), [#86](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/pull/86))

  * What it does: Allows the user to view the menu of a selected vendor in the GUI.

  * Justification: This feature reduces clutter in the screen as the vendor list is not important to the user after the user has

    selected a vendor.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for users to save and load their order items in their presets. (Pull request [#142](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/pull/142))

  * What it does: Allows the user to load their presets from a json file. Users are able to create a preset for that vendor and give the preset a name. The user is able to load the preset using its name and they can modify the order items after the preset is loaded before submitting. 
  
  * Highlights: If the preset is saved with an already existing name, it will be overwritten. Implemented execute portion of save and load preset commands.
