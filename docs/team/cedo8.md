## Project: Hospify

**Hospify** is an application to help maintain medical records.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=cedo8)
  * Added and modified test cases for Patient fields. (Pull request [\#53](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/53), [\#96](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/96))
  * Fixed and maintained code pertaining to `add`, `edit`, `find` and `delete` commands. (Pull request [\#38](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/38), [\#53](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/53), [\#144](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/144), [\#224](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/224), [\#226](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/226))

* **Enhancements implemented**: 
  * Added the NRIC field in Patient. (Pull request [\#6](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/6))
    * What it does: allows patients to be identified by a unique alphanumeric string.
    * Justification: Hospify requires a way to uniquely identify its patients
    * Highlights: requires an implementation of a new class and changes to be made to pre-existing classes
  
  * Added the Medical Record URL field in Patient. (Pull request [\#96](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/96))
    * What it does: allows users to store url to patients' online medical record and be able to access the link and make edits to the records when required.
    * Justification: provides users with the flexibility to connect to external online platform to update and maintain patient's medical record
    * Highlights: requires an implementation of a new class and changes to be made to pre-existing classes
