## Project: IntelliBrary

IntelliBrary is a desktop library management application used for library administrators to manage books. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature** view the `usage` of a book [#106](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/106) [#219](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/219)
    * What it does: allows the librarian to view the usage of a selected book.
    * Justification: this feature provides a useful service for the librarian to retrieve the borrowed times of a certain book,
      which will be useful for library management statistics(such as providing critical information for checking popularity of a book).
    * Tests: tests are also written.

* **New Feature** view the `history` of the whole IntelliBrary [#104](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/104)
    * What it does: allows the librarian to view the total borrowed times of all books.
    * Justification: this feature provides a useful service for the librarian to retrieve the total times of a certain book,
      which will be useful for library management statistics(such as providing critical information for checking mobility of the library).
    * Tests: tests are also written.
