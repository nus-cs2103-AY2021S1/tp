### New Features

#### Filter Feature

This feature allows the user to filter recipes or ingredients with various criteria.

More than one multi-word search term in any sequence is allowed. Search terms (except for expiry date) do not have to be complete to fulfil a match. Search results must meet all criteria input by the user.

#### Enhancements to Existing Features

1. Built model for Recipe, added additional 'tag' attribute and modified parser accordingly. ([#115](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/pull/115), [#116](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/pull/116)).

2. Increased code coverage by writing tests for Recipe and its related commands, filter feature and attributes involved. ([#176](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/pull/176), [#182](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/pull/182)).

3. Provided sample data when the application is run locally for the first time. ([#289](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/pull/289))
