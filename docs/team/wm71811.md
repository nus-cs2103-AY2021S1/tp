## Project: tCheck

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of the 
(imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is optimized 
for Command Line Interface (CLI) users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Implementation**: Implemented the `IngredientBook`'s `storage` component, which allows the users to save the
data related to the ingredients in json format. tCheck is also able to load the data from json file when starting 
the application. (Related PRs: [\#92](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/92), [\#129](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/129), 
[\#130](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/130))
  * What it does: Allows the data related to the ingredients to be saved when the user exits the application, 
  and the data will load into tCheck when the application starts again.
  * Justification: This implementation will allow the users to view the data related to the ingredients that 
  is stored in tCheck the last time the user uses it. Thus, the user do not need to record the data manually
  each time he or she exits the program. 
  * Highlights: In this implementation, if the user starts with an empty data file, the `IngredientBook` initialized
  will contain the six pre-defined ingredients, each with an amount of 0.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list the ingredients that require the user to restock with the command `i-restock`. (Related PRs: [\#132](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/132), [\#234](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/234))
  * What it does: Allows the user to see the list of ingredients that are in shortage and should be restocked.
  * Justification: This feature enhances the user experience because without this command, a user would need to check through the list of ingredients to find the ingredients that are in shortage. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find ingredients by keywords with the command `i-find`. (Related PRs: [\#234](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/234))
    * What it does: Allows the user to find ingredients that contain the keyword(s) in their names.
    * Justification: With this feature, our target users, who are fast typists, would not
    need to scroll down the ingredient list and check line by line to find the ingredients.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to reset all ingredients' levels to zero with the command `i-reset-all`. (Related PRs: [\#71](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/71))

* **New Feature**: Added a command, `i-list`, that allows the user to view the list of ingredients. (Related PRs: [\#73](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/73))
