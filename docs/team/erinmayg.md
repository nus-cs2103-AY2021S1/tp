## Project: FaculType

FaculType is a desktop app for managing faculty members and their modules, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented Modules (including its attributes and UniqueModuleList)
  * What it is: A representation of modules that are available in the user's university/college.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to insert modules into the app.
  * Highlights: This feature is a foundation for module-related commands to be added in the future. It required an 
   in-depth analysis and understanding of how the application works as a whole (from displaying the components to
   how it stores the data).
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all modules
  * What it does: A command to show all available modules in the active semester in the module list.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to only reset the view of the module list
   while still keeping the filtered contacts list.
  * Highlights: This feature required an understanding of the model class.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to detect duplicate prefixes
  * What it does: Detects whether there's a duplicate prefix provided by the user.
  * Justification: Restricts the user by forbidding multiple prefixes in commands which doesn't
   support multiple prefixes of the same type.
  * Highlights: This feature required an understanding of how the `ArgumentMultimap` class works.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to detect any prefix from the list of required prefixes
  * What it does: Checks whether there exists at least one prefix from the list of supported prefixes by a command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the app by allowing commands (such as `find` and `findmod`) to be more
   flexible by not requiring users to provide all supported prefixes (users only need to input at least one prefix).
  * Highlights: This feature required an understanding of how the `ArgumentMultimap` class works.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
   
* **New Feature**: Displays the module list and a view of switching semesters
  * What it does: Switches the tabs in the GUI to represent the switching of semesters.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it gives users a graphical view of all the modules in
   the active semester (Semester 1 or Semester 2).
  * Highlights: This feature required an in-depth understanding of how JavaFX works (both in the design aspect and
   the functional coding aspect) and an analysis of all existing components and its CSS attributes.
