### Project: Warenager

Warenager is an **inventory application** to help tech-savvy warehouse managers to keep track of items in their warehouse.
It **optimizes management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not exhaustive of updating,
searching and ordering supplies, via Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contribution**
  * Here is the link to [my code](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=ashley&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Ashley-Lau&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
  on the tP Code Dashboard.

* **Initial set-up of code**:
  * Refactored ab3 code to suit the classes needed in Warenager. (Pull request [\#64](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/64))
    * Added base classes such as name, quantity, source, serial number and location for stock.
  * Justification: Provided a base platform for teammates to work on their commands,
   without the need to refactor the whole AB3 code before they can start working on the project.

* **Features and Enhancements implemented**
  * **New Feature**: Added the ability to add items in the storage. (Pull request [\#64](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/64), [\#149](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/149))
    * What it does: Allows the user to add new stock into the storage.
    * Justification: This is a necessary feature as it would allow users to add their new stocks into the
    database and subsequently manage their stock from there.
    * Highlights: A unique serial number will be generated for the stock.
     The serial number will contain the source of the stock (eg. company we purchase the stock from)
     so that the serial number will provide a meaningful representation of the stock.
    
  * **New Feature**: Added the ability to convert the stock book into a readable csv file. (Pull request [\#143](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/143))
    * What it does: Allows the user to convert the stock book into a readable csv file. Users can sort 
    the stock in the order of their choice using the sort command before generating the csv file.
    * Justification: This is an enhancement feature as it would allow users have a physical/soft copy of the list of stock
    to refer to for book keeping purposes.
    * Highlights: User scan name the csv generated. The name to the csv file can only be alphanumeric characters.
  
  * **Enhancement Feature**: Added low quality field to the stock. (Pull request [\#184](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/pull/184))
   * What it does: Allows users to add a low quantity field to the stock.
   * Justification: This is an enhancement feature which allows user to be notified when their stock is equal
    or fall below the low quantity field.
    * Highlights: User can set the low quantity field of their stock when adding the stock into the stock book.
     Stocks that are low in quantity will be highlighted in red in the application (Passed on the gui portion to dennis
     as he was in-charge of the gui).
