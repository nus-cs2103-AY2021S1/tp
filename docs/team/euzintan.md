## Project: Trackr

### Project Overview
Trackr is an application for teaching assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their
student records. It is uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). Trackr runs remotely on the user's computer even without internet connection. Closing Trackr would
still ensure all changes made are still saved. Trackr is written in Java and has over 14kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions

- Code contributed: [tP Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=euzintan&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&until=2020-11-09)

- **Class Implementation**: Designed and Implemented TutorialGroup class and all other classes required for its implementation.
    -   Ensured TutorialGroup class works well with Module and Students.
    -   Implemented UniqueTutorialGroupList class to ensure Tutorial Group works with Trackr's storage.

- **New Feature**: Implemented all Tutorial Group related features, including addTG, deleteTG, editTG, findTG and viewStudent.
This includes the Parsers for each of the commands as well.
    - What it does: Allows TAs to add different Tutorial Groups to different Modules
    - Justifications: TAs could be teaching multiple Tutorial Groups across different Modules. This feature helps them
    to keep their Students organised.
    - Highlights: This feature is fundamental to the functionality of Trackr. It was a challenge because its contained in
    the Module class and stores the Student class which added a layer of complexity when commands made additions, 
    deletions or changes.

- **Testing**: 
    - Wrote all test cases for all classes related to Tutorial Groups, including all parsers and commands.
    - Wrote test cases for UniqueTutorialGroupList.
