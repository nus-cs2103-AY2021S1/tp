## Project: Bamboo

Bamboo (v1.3) is a **simple desktop app for managing personal finance, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),** and targeted at college students. If you can type fast, Bamboo v1.2 can get your financial management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add categories of expenditure to the expense book.
  * What it does: Allows the user to customize the categories and manage their finances according to the categories they have defined.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may need to manage their finances with more granular precision and set more concrete goals that they can better keep track of when their expenditure is categorized.
  * Highlights: This feature is an optional extension, such that even first-time users can immediately start using the basic features of the application without having to create expenditure categories, with the implementation of a 'Default' category.

* **New Feature**: Added a default category containing a default budget that can be topped-up (or reduced) and which expenses can be tagged to and deducted from. Also added the ability for the user specify the category-budget that they want to top up, as well as reduce the budget when necessary.
