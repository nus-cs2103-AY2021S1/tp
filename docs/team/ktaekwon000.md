## Project: CliniCal

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark patients with specific colours.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it allows the user to visualise the list of patients in a more colourful manner.
  * Highlights: This enhancement enhanced my knowledge and experience with linking JavaFX UI elements to the backend logic of the applicaiton.
<br/><br/>
* **New Feature**: Added the GUI of the appointments/calendar view, via jfxtras library.
  * Justification: This feature was a core feature of our product, where users are able to add appointments to a list and visualise them on a calendar.
  * Highlights: This addition of adding an external library to the project allowed me to gain essential knowledge on the gradle dependency system, and the steps of integrating an external library into a java project.
