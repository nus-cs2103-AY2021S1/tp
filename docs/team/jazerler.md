## Project: IntelliJournal

IntelliJournal is a desktop contacts/journal management application designed for
businesspersons to keep track of their contacts information as well as their
meetings with them. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC. The project
is developed based on a previous project named AddressBook Level 3.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Team role**: In charge of code integration and PR reviews.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit the details of a given journal
                   entry (`editjournal` command).
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit existing journal entries.

  * Justification: Users may want to modify past entries without having to
                   remove and rewrite them.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=jazerler&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
