## Project: GradPad

GradPad is a one-stop solution to **module management** for Computer Science Undergraduates.
GradPad **consolidates** the modules you have taken and **displays** the remaining required modules to
ease your module planning process. A **module searching platform** is also included in GradPad, providing easy
**navigation** of modules.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=shaokiat&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=zoom&zA=shaokiat&zR=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&zACS=239.02341137123747&zS=2020-08-14&zFS=t09&zU=2020-11-05&zMG=false&zFTF=commit&zFGS=groupByRepos&zFR=false)
* **New Feature**: Added a `search` feature to search for modules from NUSMods and display it to the user. [\#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/100)
  * What it does: Allows users to search for module details using module code and displaying all module information
    onto the Result Display. Module information are fetch directly from NUSMods if internet is available, else it will 
    be fetched from local saved JSON file.
  
  * Justification: This feature is required for users to look up relevant module details that they want to find out
   about when planning for which modules to take. This command displays the module code, module title, modular credits,
   semesters, descriptions, prerequisites and preclusion directly from NUSMods. 
  
  * Highlights: To implement this feature, I created a logic class `ModuleInfoSearcher` to utilize the nusmods package
   previously created by my team mates. This logic class make method calls `NusmodsDataManager` to retrieve module 
   information directly from NUSMods using the NUSMods API. The search command then utilize `ModuleInfoSearcher` class
   to search for module information and display the information accordingly in the Result Display.
