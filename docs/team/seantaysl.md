## Project: Trackr

__Trackr__ is an application for teaching assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their 
student records. It is uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical 
User Interface (GUI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java with over 14kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=seantaysl&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByAuthors&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=seantaysl&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)

* **New Feature:** Added better UI
    * What it does: Enhanced the current UI to make it look sleeker and more appealing to the eye.
    * Justification: This feature improves the User Experience of the Trackr significantly.
    * Highlights: This feature required analysis and understanding of UI components and CSS features. Creation of new 
    CSS file for Trackr was also necessary.
    * Credits: The new Trackr CSS file is based off the original DarkTheme.
    
* **New Feature:** Added ability to display current View.
    * What it does: Allows user to see which display they are currently at on the top of Trackr.
    * Justification: This feature further improves the User Experience of Trackr as it allows user to follow the current
    view visually.
    * Highlights: This feature required the synergy of UI component and Model component.

* **New Feature:** Created Module Class.
    * What it does: It is the base class used to store Tutorial Groups that TA's are teaching.
    * Justification: It is a main component for Trackr.
    * Highlights: It was not an easy task to create the Class from scratch.

* **Enhancements to existing features:**
    * Wrote test cases for Attendance, Participation, and View command classes. ([Pull Request #212](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/212))
    * Completed the remaining test cases for TrackrParser class. ([Pull Request #194](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/194))
