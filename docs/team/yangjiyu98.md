## Project: ForgetfulNUS

ForgetfulNUS is a flashcard application designed to assist students in learning the German Language, specifically those undertaking the NUS modules LAG1201 and LAG2201, as a memory aid for vocabulary.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Predefined tags.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add in predefined tags, difficulty and gender tags, for each flashcard. 
  * Justification: This allows the users to categorize words specifically according to the German language. The gender tags are also a significant part of the flashcard app as the German language may differ significantly from English in this aspect. This aids the users in understanding and learning the German vocabulary.
  * Highlights: This allowed a new form of sorting and grouping when integrated with my teammate's sorting feature.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=yangjiyu98&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&until=2020-11-09&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=YangJiyu98&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2`, `v1.2.1`, `v1.3`, `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub
  * Took charge of the demo for v1.2 and v1.3 ([v1.2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1INOtnhYMQ-rDAKKScVn7QFwIudYHpcUPikhlMqYaj68/edit?usp=sharing), [v1.3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vByEjMQdAdeBqJNKbx9RumT3oKOSrerm/view?usp=sharing)).

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
