## Project: Ace CS2103/T

Ace CS2103/T is a desktop task manager application used for keeping track of tasks for CS2103/T Software Engineering. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense_link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=zhang-yunjie&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Logic Component**: Add and modify classes for all commands
    * What it does: Specify logic for creation of each valid command and expected behavior.
    * Justification: It works together with relevant parser classes and model classes to operate commands on sample task list.
    * Related Pull Request: [#85](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/pull/85), [#151](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/pull/151),
    [#168](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/pull/168)
   
* **Model Component**: Modify classes under Model Components
    * What I did: Modify and refactor model components to comply with design of logic component.
    * Justification: Model Component provides the basic functions for interactions between objects, which are used in design of Logic Component.
    * Related Pull Request: [#85](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/pull/85), [#104](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/pull/104)
    
* **Sample Data**: Modify sample data to simulate actual task data of CS2103/T module
    * What it does: Be loaded as the initial list of tasks when the app opens.
    * Justification: To simulate the actual scenario of using the app for the target users.
    * Related Pull Request: [#162](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/pull/162)
    
* **Exception handling**: Add exceptions with meaningful content to warn users of invalid input
    * What it does: Return meaningful exception messages when user input is invalid.
    * Justification: To notify users what is wrong in their input and provide correct input format as reference.
