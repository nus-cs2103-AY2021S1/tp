## Project: NUStorage

NUStorage is a desktop inventory/finance managing application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Contributions to Team Based Task

I helped my teammates in debugging, including identifying sources of major bugs that could break our programme.

### Community

I helped reviewed bugs for [Team W15-4](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp) as part of the PE dry run, and reported 7 errors. These errors range from minor suggestions and inaccuracies in the user guide, to major bugs that can affect the programme.
