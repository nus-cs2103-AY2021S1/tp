## Project: Addendum for Teaching Assistants (ATAS)

**ATAS** is a desktop application designed to be a handy in-class companion for CS1010S Teaching Assistants. 
It aims to **elevate users' efficiency** and make their experience of handling administrative tasks as **seamless** as possible. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
AB3 has about 10 kLoC, while **ATAS** has about 20 kLoC modified/added on top.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added session and session list related features, including presence and participate.
  * What it does: allows the user add sessions to the session list, toggle presence and participation status of student, then saving relavent data locally.
  * Justification: This feature is the main purpose of this app, which allows users to record down key information.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.

* **New Feature**: Added student and session presence/participation statistics.
  * What it does: calculates the statistics (i.e. percentage of presence and participation) of students in every session and statistics of each invidual student in the class.
  * Justification: This feature make it easier to obtain statistical data since thing are calculated automatically.
