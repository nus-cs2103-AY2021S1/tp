## Overview

Reeve is a desktop companion application for one-on-one private tutors designed to help them better manage their students' academic and administrative needs.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions

* **Major enhancement implemented**: developed the **exam feature** of **Reeve** under academic features.
    * What it does: Allows the user to add/delete examination records to a particular student. It also allows users to view the exam statistics of a particular student.

    * Justification: This feature is crucial for a private tutor as it allows the private tutor to monitor his/her students' academic progress.
In other words, his/she will be able to track each individual students' academic performance.
As a result, the private tutor will be able to not only keep track of which students need more help while also gauging his/her capability as a teacher.

* **Major enhancement implemented**: developed the **GUI** of **Reeve**.
    * What it does: This feature provides a pleasant interaction between User and **Reeve** by strategically deciding how to display information to users.

    * Justification: In most products, a well-developed UI/UX is imperative in not only landing a good first impression from potential users but it also keeps users
interested in using the product.

* **Major enhancement implemented**: developed the **toggle feature** of **Reeve**.
    * What it does: Allows the user to toggle in between displaying administrative and academic details of students.

    * Justification: As aforementioned above, a well-developed UI/UX is imperative to users, hence this feature ensures that the
    display of student inform is kept clean and neat without much cluttering.

* **Minor enhancement implemented**:
    * Updated `add` command which allows users to add students along with their administrative details.
