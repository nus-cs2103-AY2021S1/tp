## Project: LogOnce

LogOnce is a one-stop logistics tracker app for clerks to monitor shipping statuses of all clients and perform common 
logistics operations. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.  

* **New Feature**: List Client
    [\#51](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/51)
    [\#66](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/66)
    [\#152](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/152)
  * What it does: allow the user to list all clients 
  * Highlights: This enhancement is linked to the buttons available in the GUI, where users are able to simply click on Clients to view the list as well. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user is able to conveniently view the list of the clients.

* **New Feature**: List Order
    [\#51](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/51)
    [\#66](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/66)
    [\#152](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/152)
  * What it does: allow the user to list orders
  * Highlights: This enhancement is linked to the buttons available in the GUI, where users are able to simply click on Orders to view the list as well. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user is able to conveniently view the list of the orders.
  
* **New Feature**: Undo
    [\#105](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/105)
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to undo them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: Adapted the existing feature from AB4 to fit our program.
