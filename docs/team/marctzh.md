## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a desktop application for **managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, PlaNus can get your tasks managed faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Project management**: Update the README and website pages.
  * Update the README and website markdowns to be consistent with our project
  * Managed releases `v1.1 - v1.2` (2 releases) on GitHub

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]() (to be updated)

* **Documentation**: (to be updated)

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): (to be updated)
