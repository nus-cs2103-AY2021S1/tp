## Introduction

This page serves to document my contributions to the project PlaNus under NUS module CS2103T in AY20/21 semester 1. 

## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a **task managing desktop application** for students in NUS with many projects and deadlines, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is now simple and quick!


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: Added the ability to add lessons.

  * What it does: Easy-to-use CLI commands to add a particular lesson according to a set of specified attributes.
  * Justifications: The `lesson`  command is integral in managing a student's schedule.
  * Highlights: This feature requires clever design and integration with the event class to ensure that lessons are added as events on the right days throughout the specified time period. 

* **New Features**: Added a check to see if an event or lesson overlaps.

  * What it does: Does not allow users to add events and lessons that overlap .
  * Justifications: Users may accidentally schedule multiple tasks that overlap
  * Highlights: This feature requires meticulous planning of the many possible scenarios where an overlap may occur.

* **New Features**: Added the data analysis feature.

  * What it does: allow the user to know total time spent on each task/lesson for a specified time period.
  * Justifications: This is a key feature of PlaNus as the user is able to know how much time he has allocated to each module so that he can increase his productivity.
  * Highlights: This feature requires the use of a custom algorithm and data structure which goes through PlaNus' database and keeps track of how much time is spent on task and lessons for each module.

* **Project management**:

  * Manage the milestones `v1.2`, `v1.3` and `v1.4` (including issues and deadlines) on GitHub. 

* **Code contributed**:
