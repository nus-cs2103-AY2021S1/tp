## Project: Wishful Shrinking

Wishful Shrinking is a desktop application for managing your diet, keeping track of your on-hand ingredients, recipes, as well as the food you’ve eaten (along with their calories). While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add recipes to the recipe list.
  * What it does: allows the user to add recipes to his/her collection.
  * Justification: This feature helps the user accumulate healthy recipes for future reference in preparing meals.
 
* **New Feature**: Added the custom text area class for command box.
  * What it does: handles enter key press from user and filter out other key presses.
  * Justification: This feature improves the efficiency of the previous implementation of the command box as a text field. With a text area,
  users can see the whole command in full view.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires extensive research on JavaFx components and event listeners.
  
* **New Feature**: Added responsive image layout.
  * What it does: changes the image sizes according to window sizes.
  * Justification: This feature significantly improves the look of the app.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires extensive research on JavaFx components and event listeners.

  * What it does: displays information to users.

* **New Feature**: Added UI components: Recipe Side Drawer.
