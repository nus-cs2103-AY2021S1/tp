**Summary of contributions**

* Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=seanjyjy&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Features and Enhancements implemented:**
  * Convert the whole mock-ui into code and link it to be functional code. (Pull request [\#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/100), [\#144](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/144), [\#157](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/157), [\#164](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/164))
    * Highlights: It has a very modern design that is very different from AB3. There were much consideration into designing and implementing the Ui to fix the 4 data types that we have. There are tabs to simulate the different screens for the different data types. In order to allow the user to see more information regarding a particular item, an extra view section is included on the right of the Ui.
  * Switch tab (Pull request [\#104](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/104))
    * Highlights: This command required careful planning as we were considering how should the app "work" for the best User Experience. Ultimately, we decided that we will help to improve the User Experience by helping them to switch tabs if they were to execute commands for other tabs. Thus this command become solely for the user to just switch between the tabs without having to execute commands that might cause changes.
  * Find Applications (Pull request [\#190](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/190), [\#198](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/198))
