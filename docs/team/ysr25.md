## Project: Bagel

Bagel is a desktop flashcard application based off [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
