## Project: DSAce

DSAce is a desktop flashcard application used for teaching CS2040S concepts. The user interacts with it using a CLI
, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11K LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to answer quiz questions.
  * What it does: allows the user to answer an intended question in quiz mode. The question can be of type either True
  -False or MCQ.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may be unsure of whether they had
   mastered the concepts in CS2040S. Hence, this feature allows the user to optimise their learning by verifying their
    knowledge.
