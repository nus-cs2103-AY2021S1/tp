## Introduction

This page serves to document my contributions to the project PlaNus under NUS module CS2103T in AY20/21 semester 1. 

## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a **task managing desktop application** for students in NUS with many projects and deadlines, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is now simple and quick!


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: Created new UI
  * Fully in charge of the Ui.
  * Redesigned and implemented a new Ui for PlaNus with minor parts based on the original AddressBook-Level3 Ui. 
  * Highlights: 
    * Designed and styled the task, lesson list, and the time analysis panel. 
    * Designed and implemented the calendar view from scratch. 
    * Worked out all the connections between the frontend code and backend code alone.
