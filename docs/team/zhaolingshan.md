## Project: MyMods

MyMods is a desktop mod tracking application used for tracking mods in NUS.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to start editing a semester.
  * What it does: allows the user to start editing a particular semester one at a time.
  The user can add, delete, update the grade or semester, and S/U modules in a semester only after the user starts that specific semester.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can edit the modules in a specific semester and keep track of the modules
  he is taking in a specific semester, and the changes he made to them. It provides a convenient way to segregate the modules in different semesters to keep it organised and enhance readability.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to stop editing a semester.
  * What it does: allows the user to stop editing a particular semester one at a time.
  The user cannot add, delete, update the grade or semester, and S/U modules in a semester after the user exits that specific semester.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can stop editing the modules in a specific semester which allows the user to navigate to and make changes to the modules in a different semester.
  This allows users to make changes to the modules in different semesters. It provides a convenient way to segregate the modules in different semesters to keep it organised and enhance readability.
  Once the user is done editing a specific semester, he will be brought back to the main list of modules.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to automatically and instantly calculate and display the current CAP.
  * What it does: calculates the CAP automatically after every modification the user makes including adding a module, updating the grade of a module, deleting a module and S/U-ing a module.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view how each change he makes will affect the CAP and see an instantaneous change in the CAP without having to do any manual calculations.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the UI.

* **Project management**:
  * Contributed and aided debugging of releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Edited `add` command to add a module with several parameters only after the user has started a semester (Pull request [\#52](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/52))
  * Sorted the main list of modules according to semester (Pull request [\#87](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/87))
  * Edited `done` command to omit user input of semester to prioritise fast typists (Pull request [\#96](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/96))
  * Updated and shortened the prefixes used to prioritise fast typists (Pull request [\#193](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/193))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete`, `done` and `find` (No PR by me as we typed collectively in Google Docs and pushed by one person)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `start semester` feature (No PR by me as we typed collectively in Google Docs and pushed by one person)
    * Edited the description and diagrams for the UI component (No PR by me as we typed collectively in Google Docs and pushed by one person)

* **Community**:
  * Number of PRs reviewed: 35
  * Reported 9 bugs and suggestions with in-depth explanations and detailed annotated screenshots for other teams in PE-D
