## Project: FitEgo

FitEgo is a desktop application for fitness instructors to schedule, and keep track of his/her customers' progress and payments in one place. 
It is faster compared to manually tracking administrative matters using alternative software like Excel and Google Calendar. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 

It is written in Java, and has about 23 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add in Session List in RightSideBar.
  * What it does: allows the user to view sessions, sorted by time, in one glance.
  * Justification: This feature allows a user to quickly check when he's available/busy.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as I had to learn JavaFx quickly.
  * Credits: *{Reused code from the Client List to implement Session List}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change view of Session List.
  * What it does: allows the user to filter the Session List to only those that start within the requested period.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now re-prioritise and make changes to their schedule much more conveniently.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing session-related and schedule-related commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the Logic component.
  * Credits: *Credits to teammates Tan Wei Jie for adding variable range ability and Maguire Ong for assisting with Ui-related matters of the Session List*

* **New Feature**: Added a weight unit utility class to facilitate conversion of units.
  * What it does: allows the user to both input and output weight in terms of kilogram or pounds.
  * Justification: This feature improves the usability of the product significantly because it widens the scope of users to include both categories of people who use Metric and Imperial systems.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing weight-related commands and graph. 
    The implementation was challenging because it was built to reduce coupling with other classes and required usage of Observer pattern to enable dynamic updates.
  
* **New Feature**: Added a Settings window.
  * What it does: allows the user to quickly open a window to edit settings using F4 key / CLI. It also saves the changes in UserPrefs for the next time the user starts up.
  * Justification: This feature serves as a frame for any other editable settings to be added in future.
  * Highlights: It necessitated the implementation of an additional user preference field. 
  * Credits: *Reused code from the Help window to implement the Settings window*
