## Project: Inventory Book (OneShelf)

OneShelf is an app designed as a one-stop platform for restaurant managers to handle their management needs such as having efficient inventory management 
and up-to-date information on pending deliveries, which translates to savings in man-hours and minimal losses due to over stocking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=T12-1&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=halcon-blanco&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=)

* **Project management**:
  * Weekly meetings to decide the direction of the project

* **Implemented a max quantity field for inventory items**
  * What it does: Allows users to set an ideal stock level for each item in the inventory. Updates colours in the GUI to reflect stock level
  * Justification: Restaurant managers need to be aware which of their stocks are running low and need restocking
  * Pull Request [#87](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/87)
  
* **Reorganised the layout of the GUI**
  * What it does: Reorganised the GUI to split the window into two sections: items and deliveries, with the help messages at the bottom
  * Justification: It is a more simplistic layout that focuses on the important things on the window
  * Pull Request [#106](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/106)

* **Implemented the Find command for deliveries**
  * What it does: Allows users to search for deliveries with particular fields
  * Justification: Restaurant managers need to be able to quickly find and refer to particular deliveries
  * Pull Request [#115](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/115)
  
* **Implemented Undo and Redo commands**
  * What it does: Allows users to undo any action and redo any undone action
  * Justification: Mistakes are often made in the usage of any app
  * Pull Requests [#141](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/141), [#147](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/147),
