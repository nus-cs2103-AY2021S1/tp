## Project: PIVOT (Police Investigation Virtual Organisational Tool)

PIVOT is a desktop application to assist the police investigators in keeping track of their investigations and relevant information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.  

* **New Feature**: Implemented `Suspect` class in PIVOT. (Pull request [\#78](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/78))
  * What was done: Set up the base class `Suspect` and refactored relevant components of a `Case` to accommodate for the `Suspect`.
  * What it does: The base class and the refactored components will then further be used by the team to develop the `Case` class, a major component in PIVOT.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was carefully designed to integrate with the existing commands, keeping in mind of future extensions.  


* **New Feature**: Implemented `Description` class in PIVOT. (Pull request [\#81](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/81))
  * What was done: Set up the base class `Description` and refactored relevant components of a `Case` to accommodate for the `Suspect`. Abstracted most of the common functionalities of `Description`, `Title` and `Name` into a parent `Alphanumeric` class. (Update: `Description` class is subsequently refactored. It is no longer an `Alphanumeric`)
  * What it does: The base class and the refactored components will then further be used by the team to develop the `Case` class, a major component in PIVOT.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was carefully designed to integrate with the existing commands, keeping in mind of future extensions.  


* **New Feature**: Implemented `AddDescriptionCommand` in PIVOT. (Pull request [\#126](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/126))
  * What was done: Set up the command class as well as its `Parser` to parse the command in PIVOT.
  * What it does: The user can now add a `Description` to a `Case` by calling `add desc d:[description]`.
  * Highlights: This enhancement builds on existing commands and allows extensions for commands added in the future. It follows existing design structures for its implementation. It was carefully designed to integrate with the existing commands, keeping in mind of future extensions.

* **Project management**:
  * **Manage Team Progress and Tasks**:
    * Setting up Team Github Repo/Org: [Github Link](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp)
    * Maintaining Issue Tracker and Milestones
    * Maintain existing documentation: README.md, AboutUs.md and SettingUp.md (Pull requests [\#44](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/44), [\#51](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/51), [\#71](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/71))
    
  * **Code Quality and Standardisation**:
    * Ensured that the code follows the Coding Style/Principles taught in class (such as applying SLAP and having proper abstractions). (Pull request [\#138](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/138))
    * Defensive Programming: Increased assertions, loggings and checks done in the code base to ensure that the code is defensive. (Pull requests [\#138](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/138), [\#143](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/143))  


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * **Front-End Development:** Managed the GUI updates and implementations.
    * **Updated the GUI color scheme**: (Pull request [\#227](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/227)) Implemented `BlueTheme.css` to serve as the main theme of the app while the original `DarkTheme.css` is converted for our `Archive` section.
    * **GUI Layout**: (Pull requests [\#111](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/111), [\#227](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/227)) Improved the GUI layout, such as implementing panels that are resizeable to improve readability of the content.
    * **Command Line Interaction**: (Pull requests [\#111](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/111), [\#169](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/169)) Integrated command updates in the GUI (such as switching of pages or tabs) when users enter the corresponding commands in the CLI. Users can thus change the GUI as they wish through the CLI instead of using a mouse.
    
  * **Testing:** 
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 54% to 66% (Pull request [\#158](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/158))
    * Ensured that the tests for existing features in v1.3 sufficiently covers the code. (Pull request [\#158](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/158))  


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Adapted AB3 Introduction for PIVOT (Pull request [\#45](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/45))
