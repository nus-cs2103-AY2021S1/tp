## Project: Jarvis

Jarvis is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers) to help Avengers keep track of their grading duties and consultations.
The user interacts with it using CLI and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has more than 10kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to scrape Sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg for grading information.
  * What it does: Automatically logs in to SA with the user login details and parses for student names, current missions and quests to be graded.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because an Avenger can get all the grading information he needs simply by starting up the app.
  * Highlights: Memorable learning experience was implementing multithreading into the fetching from SA and updating of JavaFX's UI-update thread. A real educational experience by learning about the nuances of when threads run and how to make them run when you want them to.
  * Credits: *Google Chrome's Chrome Driver for the ability to launch a headless Chrome browser to scrape for information.*

* **New Feature**: Added an edit command that allows users to edit their login information.
  * What it does: Edits the nusnetid and password required to login so that different Avengers can access the application.
  * Justification: This allows greater portability and ease of entering login details into the app since login details can be changed on the fly.

* **New Feature**: Added an edit command that allows users to edit their student information.
  * What it does: Edits the username, telegram username and email of the fetched students from SA so that they can remain updated.
  * Justification: This allows Avengers to use the app as a one-stop hub of all information they need to carry out their TA duties.
