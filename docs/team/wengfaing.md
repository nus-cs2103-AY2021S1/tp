## Project: Inventory Book (OneShelf)

OneShelf is an app designed as a one-stop platform for restaurant managers to handle their management needs such as having efficient inventory management 
and up-to-date information on pending deliveries, which translates to savings in man-hours and minimal losses due to over stocking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=t12&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=wengfaing&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=)

* **Project management**:
  * Weekly meetings to decide the direction of the project

* **Implemented the Remove command for items**
  * What it does: Allows the user to remove a specified quantity from an existing item
  * Justification: This feature allows users to edit their existing inventory without having to delete and re-add an item.
  * Pull Request [#71](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/71)
  
* **Implemented metric field for inventory items**
  * What it does: Allows the user to input a `metric` for each item in the inventory
  * Justification: Items in a restaurant's inventory are usually measured using a particular metric, eg kg or litres.
  * Pull Request [#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/100)
  
* **Implemented order in advance feature**
  * What it does: Allows the user to input a time for each delivery.
  * Justification: Deliveries from a restaurant might have variable delivery time based on how busy the restaurant is.
  * Pull Request [#202](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/202) 
  
* **Implemented sorting for Deliveries**
  * What it does: Deliveries shown in the GUI will be sorted based on how urgent (time till delivery) they are.
  * Justification: Deliveries that are either overdue or that should be completed urgently should be more visible, and shown at the top.
  * Pull Request [#202](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/202) 
  
* **Updated GUI for individual Item and Delivery**
  * What it does: Added an item's metric next to its quantity. Added time till delivery at the bottom of each delivery.
  * Justification: Improve visual clarity for users.
