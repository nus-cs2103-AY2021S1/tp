## Project: CliniCal

CliniCal is a desktop application that allows doctors to manage patient records and schedule upcoming appointments. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Implementation**: Implemented Appointment.
  * What it does: Appointment stores the details of an upcoming appointment with a patient.
  * Justification: This implementation allows the user to schedule upcoming appointments and prevent any time conflicts. Appointment objects are also integrated with calendar to allow the user to view the weekly schedule.
  * Highlights: This implementation is fundamental for managing patient appointments, which is one of the main features. It required an extensive understanding of the jfxtras library and its components. The implementation was challenging as Appointment had to be converted to VEvent for integration with the calendar feature.
  * Credits:
    1. For understanding of iCalendar and its components : [iCalendar.org](https://icalendar.org)
    2. For implementation of VEventUtil : [Njoy Teaching Assistant's EventUtil](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util/EventUtil.java)

* **New Implementation**: Implemented JSON Serialization for Appointment.
  * What it does: Appointment objects are serialized into json file format and clinical.json is deserialized into Appointment objects.
  * Justification: This implementation allows the user to automatically save the appointments in json file format and to load previously saved appointments when the application is restarted.
  * Highlights: This implementation is fundamental for saving and loading patient appointments. It required an in-depth understanding of JSON serialization.

* **New Implementation**: Added new field objects for patients.
  * What it does: New patient field objects allow the user to manage the extensive details of a patient, including NRIC, sex, blood type, and allergies.
  * Justification: This addition improves user's management of patient records that are essential during consultations.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing and future Patient commands. It required an in-depth understanding of regex to validate different patient fields.
    
* **New Implementation**: Implemented the base code for Visit and VisitHistory.
  * What it does: Visit stores the details of a patient's visit. VisitHistory stores the list of visits for each patient.
  * Justification: This implementation enhances user's management of patient records since a user can store details of a patient visit and refer to past visits.
  * Highlights: This implementation is fundamental for managing patient visit records, which is one of the main features.
  * Credits:
    1. For implementation of Visit: [VISIT's VisitReport](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/model/person/VisitReport.java)
    1. For implementation of VisitHistory: [VISIT's VisitList](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/model/person/VisitList.java)
    
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit appointments.
  * What it does: The new feature allows the user to edit details of existing appointments.
  * Justification: This feature improves user's management of appointments because a user can make mistakes in scheduling appointments and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This implementation required a careful consideration of design alternatives and validity checking mechanisms as schedule conflicts and addition of overdue appointments had to be prevented, based on the current time.
