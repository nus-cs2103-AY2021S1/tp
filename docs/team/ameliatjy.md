## Project: CANdidates

*CANdidates* is a powerful contact management desktop App optimised for job recruiters to manage job applicants.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

### Contributions Summary

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=ameliatjy&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByAuthors&breakdown=false&tabOpen=false)

* **New Feature**: Job Listings (Pull requests [\#84](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/84) and [\#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/94))
  * What it does: This feature enables a job listing to be represented in the application.
  * Justification: This is the preliminary modification of AB3 uniquely into *CANdidates*, for subsequent features to be rolled out for job listings.
  * Highlights: This allows job recruiters to store job listings in *CANdidates* to keep track of all jobs with recruitment opportunities.

* **New Feature**: Find Candidate(s) (Pull requests [\#148](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/148), [\#153](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/153) and [\#167](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/167))
  * What it does: Enables the user to find candidates with field(s) that contain(s) keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a typical job recruiter has many candidates to handle, this feature will provide a convenient way for them to look for suitable candidates that fulfil a certain criteria and streamline their search.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging as it requires chaining of various predicates, based on the fields specified by the user, to achieve the desired outcome. An in-depth understanding of the code base and its logic flow are required due to the numerous other classes involved.
