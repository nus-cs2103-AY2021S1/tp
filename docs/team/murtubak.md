## Project: Cap 5.0 Buddy

### Project Overview

Cap 5 Buddy is a project developed for a software engineering module (CS2103T) at the National University of Singapore.
It has a GUI created using JavaFX, and it is written in Java.

### Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete modules.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove a module from the Module List.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the user to remove unnecessary modules from the Module List.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
