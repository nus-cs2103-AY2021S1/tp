## Project: Calo

Calo is a desktop app that is designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI).

We built Calo upon the [Address Book Level 3 (AB3) project](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create goals. (Pull requests [\#185](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/185))
  * What it does: allows the user to create a new goal at a particular date. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a Calo user must be able to create goals for the number of calories burnt in order to be accountable for his fitness.
    The implementation was fairly difficult because it required the creation of separate goalBook to keep track of goals.

* **Existing Feature Update**: Update list and find commands to ensure that they were working with the new Calo desktop application. (Pull requests [\#32](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/32), [\#39](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/39))
