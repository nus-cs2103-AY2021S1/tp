<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: &nbsp; Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-expense t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Bubble Tea`.
  Any leading/trailing whitespaces will be ignored. e.g. `add t/   Bubble Tea` and `add t/Bubble Tea   ` will be treated as `add t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets (`[]`) are optional.<br>
  e.g `t/TITLE [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `t/Bubble Tea c/Food & Beverage` or as `t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets, with `...` after the parameter, can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY...]` can be used as `c/Food & Beverage`, `c/Food & Beverage c/Tea` etc, or even omitted completely.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* Any leading/trailing whitespaces for the user input as a whole will be ignored. e.g. `   find t/Bubble Tea   ` will be treated as `find t/Bubble Tea`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

The formats of the parameters used in the rest of the document are as follows:
* `TITLE`, `TITLE_KEYPHRASE` and `CATEGORY` should consist of printable ASCII characters.

    Below is an exhaustive list of printable ASCII characters (excluding line breaks):

    mnopqrstuvwxyz !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~

  An optional `$` may be included in front as well.

    * Days should only range from 1 to 28, 29, 30, or 31 (all inclusive),
    depending on the number of days in the given month and whether the given year is a leap year.
  * For day and month values, single-digit values must be padded with leading zeroes, meaning that a value of 5 should be written as `05` instead of `5`.
  * For year values, it must be written in the standard 4-digit format, so 2019 should be written as `2019` and not just `19`.

A **bookmark income** is a template that allows you to create incomes that you make frequently, such as monthly salary or stipend for being a teaching assistant.
You can convert a bookmark income repeatedly to create as many incomes as you want, and the created incomes will automatically be added to Fine<span>$</span><span>$</span>e's incomes list.

To help you manage your finances, Fine\$\$e records the following information about each of your bookmark incomes:
1. **Title**: A descriptive title, to remind you what the bookmark income is about.
1. **Amount**: How much money you will receive each time you convert the bookmark income into an income.
1. **Categories**: Any number of categories, to help you group related incomes together.

### 4.10 Clear Data: `clear`

Ready to start using Fine\\$\\$e?
This command allows you to clear *all* existing data inside the finance tracker. That includes:

Format: `clear`

> :warning: &nbsp; This is a powerful command. You might lose your precious data if you are not careful with it.

To protect against accidental usage, this command needs to be entered **twice in succession** before it takes effect.

* Scenario B: Enter `clear`, then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is cleared.
* Scenario C: Enter `clear`, then enter `lsi` (a valid command), then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is unchanged.
  * The first `clear` command has been nullified, so Fine\\$\\$e requests for a second `clear` command as confirmation.
* Scenario D: Enter `clear`, then enter `foo` (an invalid command), then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is unchanged.
  * The first `clear` command has been nullified, so Fine\\$\\$e requests for a second `clear` command as confirmation.
* Scenario E: Enter `clear`, then enter `lsi`, then enter `clear` again, then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is cleared.

Example Usage:
```
