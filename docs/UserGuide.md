### Using Nuudle

This section will walk you through the layout of Nuudle. 


![UiMarkUp](images/UiMarkup.png)

The layout of Nuudle can be divided into 2 main areas:
1. The command execution area
2. The main viewing area

#### Executing commands

The command execution area consists of the *Command Box* and the *Result Display Box*.

The *Command Box* is the area where you can type in your command and subsequently execute it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
The result from the execution will then be displayed in the *Result Display Box*.

To get you started, here are some sample commands that you can try out:

1. **`help`** : Shows the help window.

1. **`list`** : Lists all patients.

  <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{:start="3"}
1. **`add`**` n/John Doe i/S9730284G p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the patient book.

1. **`assign`**` 1 d/Tomorrow t/8.30am dur/30` : Creates an appointment for the 1st patient in the patient list for tomorrow 8.30am to 9am, assuming that the time slot is free.

1. **`view`**` d/Tomorrow` : Displays all appointment happening tomorrow.

1. **`cancel`**` 1` : Cancels the first appointment in the displayed appointment list.

1. **`clear`** : Deletes all patients and appointments.

1. **`exit`** : Exits the app.

To learn more about the various commands used in Nuudle, head down to our [Commands](#commands) section.

Alternatively, you can visit our [Command Summary](#command-summary) section to get a quick overview of Nuudle's commands.

#### Viewing data

The main viewing area consists of the *Patient Book*, the *Appointment Book* and the *Appointment Overview*.

* The *Patient Book* contains information about the patients stored in Nuudle. Here we take a look at an entry in the Patient Book.
  ![PatientCard](images/PatientCard.png)
  
  * The *Patient Index* is a numbering system used in the Patient Book, which allows you to easily reference the patient by using the index shown.
  Throughout the document and the application, we use the term `PATIENT_INDEX` to refer to this numbering.

  * The *Medical Condition* here is a tag that help nurses easily identify any identified allergy, illness and more.
  This medical condition can be added as a tag when [adding a new patient](#adding-a-patient--add) or by [editing an existing patient](#editing-a-patient--edit).

  * The *Patient Details* are neatly displayed at the bottom for you to easily check and identify a patient.

<br>
* The *Appointment Book* contains details about the appointments created by Nuudle. Here we take a look at a single entry in the Appointment Book 
![AppointmentCard](images/AppointmentCard.png)

  * Similar to the Patient Index, the *Appointment Index* is a numbering system used in the Appointment Book.
  We use the term `APPT_INDEX` to refer to this numbering.

  * Another important part of an appointment is the *Appointment Status*. There are four status types used in Nuudle and the meaning of each status is shown in the table below:

  **Appointment Status** | **Meaning**
  :---------------:|:----------------
  ![StatusDone](images/StatusDone.png) | A completed appointment that has been marked as done using the `done` command
  ![StatusUpcoming](images/StatusUpcoming.png) | An uncompleted appointment that will be happening in the future.
  ![StatusOngoing](images/StatusOngoing.png) | An appointment that is currently ongoing but is still uncompleted.
  ![StatusExpired](images/StatusExpired.png) | An appointment that has already passed but is still uncompleted.

  * The *Patient Details* in the appointment entry provides the basic information of the patient, namely the name and the contact number.
  This allows you to easily keep track of who will be coming for the appointment and also call up the patient, if necessary.

<br>
* Lastly, the *Appointment Overview* provides simple statistics about the appointments stored in Nuudle.

  ![AppointmentOverview](images/AppointmentOverview.png)
  
  With it, you can: 
  * keep track of the total number of expected appointments for the day.
  * stay updated on the remaining number of appointments to be completed for the day.
  * get an estimate on how busy the clinic will be for the rest of the week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commands

The command is the main way to schedule appointment for a patient with Nuudle.

This section introduces three types of commands:
1. [General](#general)
2. [Patient Management](#patient-management)
3. [Appointment Management](#appointment-management)
 
An overview of all the commands is also provided in the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

### Command format

This section emphasises on the common format across all command input.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/hypertension` or as `n/John Doe`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Indexes must be a **positive integer**: 1, 2, 3, ...

* Date and time can be written using various commonly used formats or even using natural language.
A summary of the supported formats and languages is shown in the table below:

</div>

### General

#### Viewing help : `help`

Opens a new window which shows the commonly used commands, and a link to access the User Guide.

![Help Message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

#### Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the patient and appointment book to the state before the previous *undoable* command was executed.
`undo` command cannot reverse a command execution from the previous Nuudle session.
 
Format: `undo`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Tip:**
Undoable commands refers to commands that modifies the patient or appointment list contents. (**add**, **edit**, **delete**, **remark**, **assign**, **change**, **cancel**, **done** and **clear**)
</div>

* There must be at least one previously executed undoable command.
* Multiple calls to `undo` will reverse multiple undoable command execution, starting from the most recent command.

Examples:
* `delete 1`<br>
  `list`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command)

* `view d/today`<br>
  `list`<br>
  `undo`<br>
   The `undo` command fails as there is no previous undoable command to reverse.

* `cancel 1`<br>
  `clear`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `clear` command)<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)

Step-by-step illustration:
1. Initial state: <br>
![UndoCommandInitialState](images/UndoRedoInitialState_UG.png)

2. Input `delete 1`: <br>
![UndoCommandStep2](images/UndoStep2_UG.png) <br>
The first patient `Alex Yeoh` is deleted.

3. Input `undo`: <br>
![UndoCommandStep3](images/UndoStep3_UG.png) <br>
The `undo` command cancels the last undoable command `delete 1`, so that 
the patient `Alex Yeoh` comes back to the list again.

#### Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. `redo` command cannot reverse an `undo` execution from the previous Nuudle session.

Format: `redo`

* There must be at least one previously executed `undo` command.
* The previously executed `undo` command should be the most recent command that modifies the lists' data.
* Multiple call to `redo` will reverse multiple `undo` command, starting from the most recent `undo` command.

Examples:
* `cancel 1` <br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `list`<br>
  `redo` (reapplies the `cancel 1` command)

* `cancel 1`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `cancel 2`<br>
  `redo`<br>
   The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `cancel 1`<br>
  `clear`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `clear` command)<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `redo` (reapplies the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `redo` (reapplies the `clear` command)

Step-by-step illustration:
1. Initial state: <br>
![RedoCommandInitialState](images/UndoRedoInitialState_UG.png)

2. Input `clear`: <br>
![RedoCommandStep2](images/RedoStep2_UG.png)

3. Input `Undo`: <br>
![RedoCommandStep3](images/RedoStep3_UG.png) <br>
All the data comes back.

4. Input `Redo`: <br>
![RedoCommandStep4](images/RedoStep4_UG.png) <br>
Redo the `clear` command, which removes all the data again.

#### Clearing all data : `clear`

Clears all appointment and patients entries.

Format: `clear`

Step-by-step illustration:<br>
1. Suppose you would like to clear the sample data to officially start using Nuudle from scratch, you can simply type in the command `clear` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.<br>
![ClearBefore](images/ClearCommand1.png)

2. All patient and appointment entries are cleared. You can now officially start adding your clinic's patient and appointment entries.<br>
![ClearAfter](images/ClearCommand2.png)

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits Nuudle.

Format: `exit`

#### Retrieving previously entered commands

By pressing the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> arrow keys in the *command box*, you can cycle through the previously executed commands.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** This feature can be used together with `undo` to correct a wrongly executed command.<br>

<br>
The steps below illustrate how this correction can be done:<br>

1. Use the `undo` command to first reverse the previous command execution.<br>

2. Next, use the <kbd>↑</kbd> arrow key in the *command box* to retrieve the original command.<br>

3. You can then edit the original command and execute it by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.<br>

<br>
With this feature, it saves you the hassle of having to retype the whole command again!
</div>

#### Saving the data

Nuudle automatically saves the patient and appointment data to your home folder after any changes are made to the data. There is no need for you to save manually.

#### Archiving past appointments

Nuudle automatically removes past appointments and saves them into an archive folder for your future reference. This is done automatically everytime you start up the Nuudle app.

The appointments are grouped by their appointment months and saved in respective Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. These files can be opened and viewed using Excel.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Backing up the data

Nuudle also keeps a backup of your data files from the previous Nuudle session in a backup folder. The backup data will be updated everytime you start up the Nuudle app.

This backup allows you to completely revert your data to the previous session's data. This is especially useful if your data was unintentionally corrupted and you need to manually restore the data.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Patient Management

#### Adding a patient : `add`

Adds a patient to the patient book.

#### Adding a remark to a patient: `remark`

Looking to add additional data unique to your patient besides the basic fields? Look no further. Use this command to add or delete a remark to an existing patient.

Format: `remark PATIENT_INDEX [r/REMARK]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
<br> Alternatively, you can use the edit command to add or edit remarks if you wish to change multiple fields (eg. Phone number) at the same time.
</div><br>

* **Adds a remark** for the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX`.
* Please click [here](#command-format) for important formatting information for the `PATIENT_INDEX` field.
* A remark is an **optional field** and can be left blank if you wish to delete the existing `REMARK`.
* A patient will have `NIL` displayed as his/her remark status if it was left empty.

### Appointment Management

#### Adding an appointment : `assign`

Assigns the specified patient into the specified appointment date and time.

Format: `assign PATIENT_INDEX d/DATE t/TIME [dur/DURATION]`

* Puts the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX` into an appointment time slot.
* The `PATIENT_INDEX` refers to the index number indicated in the patient list.
* The `PATIENT_INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The `DATE` and `TIME` of the appointment must be included.
* The `DURATION` is measured in minutes and will be defaulted to 60 minutes if omitted.
* The time slot indicated by `DATE` and `TIME` must be available.
* The specified `DATE` and `TIME` must be in the future.

Examples:
* `assign 1 d/Sunday t/2pm dur/40` books an appointment of 40 minutes on the upcoming Sunday, 2am for the 1st patient in the list.
* `assign 3 d/02-03-2021 t/1130` books an appointment of 60 minutes on 02/03/2021, 11:30am for the 3rd patient in the list.

Step-by-step illustration:<br>
Suppose `Alex Yeoh`, the first patient in the list calls to book an appointment on `02 Jan 2021` at `1130`, you can:

Format: `change APPT_INDEX [d/DATE] [t/TIME] [dur/DURATION]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
<br>If you would only like to change the duration of an appointment while keeping it's original date and time, simply
enter the new `DURATION` with it's corresponding `APPT_INDEX`! There is no need to retype it's date and time. The same
applies for the other fields.
</div>

* **Reschedules an appointment** at the specified `APPT_INDEX` for the patient it is tagged to.
* Please click [here](#command-format) to refer to important formatting information for the `DATE`, `TIME` and `DURATION` fields.
* **At least one** optional field must be provided to successfully execute the change command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Appointment details will be updated according to the fields present in the user input. For fields that are absent, the appointment's original data will be used.


Examples:
*  `change 3 d/02-03-2021` <br> Reschedules the 3rd appointment displayed in the appointment book to 2nd March 2021 with it's original time, duration and patient.
*  `change 2 d/12-05-2021 t/1530 dur/60` <br> Reschedules the 2nd appointment displayed in the appointment book to 12th May 2021, 3:30PM with a duration of 1 hour for it's original patient.

* If you wish to **modify** the duration of an existing appointment, simply call the command in the following format:
    * `change 1 dur/NEW_DURATION`: <br>Extends the duration of the first appointment at `APPT_INDEX` 1 to the `NEW_DURATION` with the same date and start time.

Step by step illustration:
