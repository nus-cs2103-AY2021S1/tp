<img src="images/tCheckLogo.png" width="200" height="200" />

Welcome to the User Guide of **tCheck**!
 
Are you a bubble tea store manager (from T-Sugar) looking to reduce your time spent on administrative work in store
management? Look no further, as tCheck can assist you with these tasks.

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of 
the (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredients tracking and manpower management. It is an
application optimized for the Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you use this application by typing
commands into a _Command Box_. If you are a fast typist, then you will be able to update and retrieve the
information in tCheck more efficiently, as opposed to using other applications that requires a mouse.

This User Guide will help you get started with tCheck and learn how to use the features that tCheck provides.
You can start from the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to learn how to obtain tCheck to begin managing
 your store more efficiently.

#### 3.2.2. General Symbols and Syntax 

The following table explains the general symbols and syntax used in this User Guide.

| Syntax |  What it means |
|----------|-------------|
| `command` |  The grey block specifies an execuable command which can be entered in the command box |
| _italics_ | Italicised text specifies the terms related to tCheck's GUI |
|<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: </div>  | An exclamation mark indicates that the following text is a note|

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.2.3. Command Syntax and Usage

The following table explains the technical terms used in this user guide.

| Technical Term | What it means |
| ---------------| --------------|
| Command Word | The first word of a command. tCheck uses this command word to decide what kinds of actions it should perform. |
| Prefix | It is the characters before every "/". They are used to distinguish different kinds of parameters. |
| Parameter | The words after every "/". They are values given to a command to perform the specified action.|

**Example:** <br>
`c-add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMERGENCY_CONTACT a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]`

**Breakdown:** 
* Command Word - `c-add` <br>
* Prefixes - `n/`, `e/`, `p/`, `a/`, `t/`  <br>
* Parameters - `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMERGENCY_CONTACT`, `ADDRESS`, `TAG`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following points explain the format of a command. 

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied.<br>
   e.g. In `c-delete INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter and the command can be used as `c-delete 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
   e.g. `c-add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMERGENCY_CONTACT a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]` can be used as `c-add n/Betsy Crowe e/81234567 p/89007413 a/Blk 120 ABC Road t/Friday` 
    or as `c-add n/Betsy Crowe e/81234567 p/89007413 a/Blk 120 ABC Road`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
   e.g. `[t/TAG] ...` can be used as `  ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Friday`, `t/Friday t/PartTime`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
   e.g. If the command specifies `p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMERGENCY_CONTACT`, `e/EMERGENCY_CONTACT p/PHONE_NUMBER` is also acceptable.
    


#### 3.2.4. Prefix processing and usage

The table below explains some important features of how prefix(es) are processed in tCheck to help you understand and use prefix(es) in commands.

Situation | What will happen
-------|------------------------------
Duplicate (2 or more) valid prefixes detected | Only the last prefix and its following parameter are accepted and processed as part of the command.
Invalid prefix entered | tCheck will not recognise this "prefix" and thus it will be processed as part of the parameter for the nearest previous valid prefix, which may result in error for the parameter.
Unexpected prefix(es) entered for commands which do not take in any parameter | tCheck will not accept or process these prefix(es) because all words entered after the command words will be ignored. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example 1:**
`i-set i/Milk i/Boba m/90`

**How the command is processed:**

In this example, the situation of duplicate valid prefixes detected takes place. Hence, only the last, in this case, the second prefix and its following parameters are accepted.
Thus, the command will be processed in the same way as `i-set i/Boba m/90`.

**Example 2:**
`i-set-all M/10 P/10 B/10 L/10 G/10 S/10 T/10`

**How the command is processed:**

In this example, the prefixes `M/`, `P/`, `B/`, `L/`, `G/` and `S/` are valid but `T/` is invalid. Hence, the situation of
invalid prefix entered takes place. Since tCheck will not be able to recognise the `T/` entered as a prefix. Thus, it will be treated as
part of the parameter for the nearest previous prefix, which is `S/`. This will cause the command to fail because `10 T/20` is an invalid format for amount and appropriate error message will be shown.

**Example 3:**
`help i/Milk i don't know what to do `

**How the command is processed:**

In this example, `help` is a command which does not take in any parameter. Hence, the situation of unexpected prefix(es) entered for commands which do not take in any parameter takes place.
Thus, tCheck will ignore all words come after the command word `help` and the command will be processed in the same way as `help`.

### 4.2. Commands - Ingredients Tracking 

The Ingredients Tracking features allows you to keep an inventory of the ingredients for a T-Sugar store inside the Ingredient Tracker.
You are able to view data related to ingredients tracking in the Ingredient Tracker inside the _Main View_.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about ingredients<a name="commands-ingredients-tracking-notes-about-ingredients"></a>:**<br>

* Unit of measurement for ingredients:<br>
   * Unit for solid items / jelly (Pearl, Boba and Brown Sugar) : **KG**<br>
   * Unit for liquids (Milk, Black Tea and Green Tea) : **L**<br>

* All ingredients' initial levels (the levels you see when running tCheck for the very first time) are set to 0.<br>

* Recording ingredients' leves to the nearest **KG**/**L** is sufficient for inventory keeping.<br>

* tCheck is designed specifically for an imaginary bubble tea brand, T-Sugar, which produces all their drinks using six ingredients. Hence, all available ingredients in a T-Sugar store are pre-defined in tCheck's ingredient book and no other ingredient can be added.<br>

* Please note that the ingredient names are **case-sensitive** to ensure consistency with the ingredient names displayed in Ingredient Tracker section of the _Main View_.<br>

* Please be informed that a prefix is chosen for an ingredient using the following logic : 
   1. Use the first letter of the ingredient name. 
   2. If that letter is taken by another ingredient, use the first letter of the second word for that ingredient. 
   3. If the ingredient name does not have a second word or if the first letter of the second word is not unique, use the second letter of the first word of the ingredient name.

* Here is a comprehensive list of all available ingredients and their pre-determined default levels in a T-Sugar bubble tea store:<br>
    * Milk, 50 L<br>
    * Pearl, 20 KG<br>
    * Boba, 20 KG<br>
    * Black Tea, 50 L<br>
    * Green Tea, 50 L<br>
    * Brown Sugar, 20 KG<br>

**:information_source: Notes about amounts:** <br>

You can use one or two leading zeros when setting the amounts if you prefer, as long as the total number of digits entered for the amount is less than or equal to three, except for zero. Zero will always be displayed as one single "0".
This applies for both setting one ingredient's level and setting all ingredients' levels.

For example, tCheck accepts `07`, `007` and `070` as valid parameters for `AMOUNT`, but `0007` is rejected.

<a name="FAQ"></a>
## 5. FAQ 

**Q**: Why does tCheck ignore additional or extra input that I add after single-word commands, like `help`? <br>
**A**: Any extra input after a single-word command, for example, the input `123` inside the input `c-list 123`, will 
be ignored because extra input does not affect the operation conducted by `c-list`. These single-word commands 
include: [`s-list`](#s-list), 
[`i-set-default`](#i-set-default), 
[`i-list`](#i-list), 
[`i-reset-all`](#i-reset-all), 
[`i-restock`](#i-restock), 
[`c-active-list`](#c-active-list), 
[`c-today`](#c-today), 
[`c-tomorrow`](#c-tomorrow), 
[`c-clear`](#c-clear), 
[`c-archive-all`](#c-archive-all), 
[`c-archive-list`](#c-archive-list), 
[`help`](#help), [`exit`](#exit).

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install tCheck in another computer and overwrite the three data files it creates (saved in the folder named
 "data" in tCheck home folder) with the files that contain the data in your previous tCheck home folder.
