## 1. Introduction

{ start of `introduction#elevate_your_efficiency` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

### 1.1. Elevate your efficiency

Hello, fellow teaching assistants of CS1010S!

Have you ever struggled with keeping track of _all_ your students' attendance and participation status for each of your classes?

Have you ever needed to make a mental note in class, only to forget about it because there was no convenient place to write it in?

Have you ever wished an application would have a more streamlined **Command Line Interface** to suit your typing prowess?

If you found yourself saying yes to any of the above, then **ATAS (Addendum for Teaching Assistants)** is ***the*** *in-class management application* for you!
Made by teaching assistants, for teaching assistants, **ATAS** aims to *elevate your efficiency* and make your experience handling administrative tasks while in class as seamless as possible.

### 1.2. Overview

**ATAS** is a **desktop application designed to be your handy in-class companion, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type really quickly, **ATAS** will help you to manage your in-class administrative needs more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Going forward, to minimize ambiguity, the following terms will be named as such:** <br>
* `classes` will be henceforth referred to as `sessions`.
* `attendance` (of student(s)) will be henceforth referred to as `presence`.

See the parts under `session` and `presence` in the [glossary](#22-glossary) for more information.

</div>

Specifically, **ATAS** allows you to keep track of four different aspects (see [Section 4 - Layout of ATAS](#4-layout-of-atas) for a graphical visualization for each aspect):

1. [Students](#41-students)
   * Keep track of all students assigned to you
   * Store their matriculation number, NUS email address, and relevant [tag(s)](#22-glossary) (if any)
1. [Sessions](#42-sessions)
   * Keep track of all sessions you will be holding for the academic year
   * These will likely mostly consist of tutorial sessions, but can include consultations as well
1. [Current session](#43-current-session)
   * Keep track of student progress within each session itself
   * Specifically, for each session, keep track of each student's [`participation`](#551-toggling-participation-status-of-students--participate) and [`presence`](#552-toggling-presence-status-of-students--presence)
1. [Memo](#44-memo):
   * Keep track of any note you think you will need to remember for later use
   * For example, take note of any interesting question raised by your student so you can follow it up with him/her after the session

### 1.3. Preview

The following is the GUI of our application:

   ![UiPreview](images/user-guide/1.3.1-UiPreview.png)
   <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 1.3.1</b>: UI Preview </sub> </p>
    

GUI Components:
   1. **Command box**: where you enter your commands.
   1. **Result box**: where the result of a command will be shown. It can show a success message, or a failure message if something wrong happens.
   1. **Status bar footer**: shows which session you are currently in.
   1. **Tabs**: shows what item type you are viewing.
   1. **View box**: where the details of the items will be shown.

{ start of `quick_start` written by: Alvin Chee Teck Weng and Marcus Tan Wei }

## 3. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. If you do not have Java version `11` and above installed, download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). Remember to choose the installer that fits your computer.

2. Download the latest `atas.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/releases). 

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **ATAS**. All the data related to **ATAS** will be stored here.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. 

5. If double-clicking do not work:
    
    a. For Windows users, you can type "cmd" in the folder path bar to open up command prompt in that directory and type "java -jar atas.jar" in the command prompt. **(Figure 3.1)**
    
    ![WindowsCommandPromptStartPage](images/user-guide/3.1-WindowsCommandPromptStartPage.png)
    
    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.1</b>: Welcome page </sub> </p>
    
    b. For Mac users, you can right click the folder you saved atas.jar in and click on "New Terminal at Folder" and type "java -jar atas.jar" in the terminal. **(Figure 3.2)**
    
    ![MacbookTerminalStartPage](images/user-guide/3.2-MacbookTerminalStartPage.png)
    
    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.2</b>: Welcome page </sub> </p>

6. The GUI similar to the below image should appear in a few seconds.<br>

    ![WelcomePage](images/user-guide/3.3-WelcomePage.png)

    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.3</b>: Welcome page </sub> </p>

7. Now click on the Student tab and notice how the app contains some sample data. <br/>

    ![StudentSampleData](images/user-guide/3.4-StudentSampleData.png)

    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 3.4</b>: Student sample data </sub> </p>

   
8. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing the `Enter` key will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`liststu`** : Lists out all the students.

   * **`addstu n/Elvin Ng m/A0123456X e/elvinng@u.nus.edu`** : Adds a student named `Elvin Ng` to the student list.

   * **`deleteses 3`** : Deletes the 3rd session shown in the current session list.
   
   * **`editses 3 s/Tutorial 2`** : Edits the 3rd session name to `Tutorial 2`.

   * **`clearstu`** : Deletes all the students.

   * **`exit`** : Exits out of the application.

9. Refer to the [Features](#5-features) below for details of each command.

## 4. Layout of ATAS

Over here, you can familiarise yourself with the different UI components of **ATAS**. **ATAS** comprises of five different tabs, including a default home tab which can be seen in [Section 1.3 - Preview](#13-preview). Each of the remaining four tabs (`Students`, `Sessions`, `Current Session` and `Memo`) supports its respective section of [features](#5-features). All four of these tabs uses the same result box and command box.

To allow you to easily keep track of students presence and participation records, **ATAS** will automatically do some calculations and display them as **statistics** in the `Students`, `Sessions` and `Current Session` tabs. The details of the calculation differs for each tab, and you can find out more about them under each sub-header.

{ end of `layout_of_atas` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `layout_of_atas#students` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 4.1. Students

The following is how the `Students` tab looks like:

![StudentsLayout](images/user-guide/4.1.1-StudentsLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.1.1</b>: Layout of `Students` tab when there is at least one student </sub> </p>

Notes:
   * **Student list box**: Contains a list of students and their particulars such as their name, matriculation number, NUS email address and [tag(s)](#22-glossary) (if any). <span style="background-color: #089788; color: white">Tags</span> are highlighted in a turquoise colour and students are arranged in the order that you add them. 
   * **Statistics**: Calculated as a percentage of the number of sessions the student was present or has participated out of all the available sessions.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the color code of a student's statistics:**<br>

|Colour | Meaning |
 |--------------|-------------|
 | <span style="background-color: #E6E6E6; color: black">Grey</span> | There are no sessions |
 | <span style="background-color: crimson; color: white">Red</span> | Student was not present or did not participate in all the sessions (<100%) |
 | <span style="background-color: green; color: white">Green</span> | Student was present or has participated in all the sessions (100%) |

</div>

If there are no students in your list, you will see a message indicating as such.

![EmptyStudentsLayout](images/user-guide/4.1.2-EmptyStudentsLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.1.2</b>: Layout of `Students` tab when there are no students </sub> </p>
   
To find out which features are supported by the `Students` tab, you can head over to [Section 5.3 - Students](#53-students).

{ end of `layout_of_atas#students` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `layout_of_atas#sessions` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 4.2. Sessions

The following is how the `Sessions` tab looks like:

![SessionsLayout](images/user-guide/4.2.1-SessionsLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.2.1</b>: Layout of `Sessions` tab when there is at least one session </sub> </p>

Notes:
   * **Session list box**: Contains a list of sessions and their details such as their name and date. Sessions are arranged by their dates, starting from the latest at the top.
   * **Statistics**: Calculated as a percentage of the number of students that was present or has participated out of all the students.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the color code of a session's statistics:**<br>

|Colour | Meaning |
 |--------------|-------------|
 | <span style="background-color: #E6E6E6; color: black">Grey</span> | There are no students |
 | <span style="background-color: crimson; color: white">Red</span> | Not all students were present or has participated (<100%) |
 | <span style="background-color: green; color: white">Green</span> | All the students were present or has participated (100%) |

</div>

If there are no sessions in your list, you will see a message indicating as such.

![EmptySessionsLayout](images/user-guide/4.2.2-EmptySessionsLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.2.2</b>: Layout of `Sessions` tab when there are no sessions </sub> </p>

To find out which features are supported by the `Sessions` tab, you can head over to [Section 5.4 - Sessions](#54-sessions).

{ end of `layout_of_atas#sessions` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `layout_of_atas#current_session` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 4.3. Current session

The following is how the `Current Session` tab looks like:

![CurrentSessionLayout](images/user-guide/4.3.1-CurrentSessionLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.3.1</b>: Layout of `Current Session` tab when a session is entered </sub> </p>

Notes:
   * **Student list box**: Similar to the `Students` tab, this box contains a list of students. However, only their names are shown here. The order of students follows that of the `Students` tab.
   * **Presence/Participation status**: If student is absent or has not participated, <span style="background-color: crimson; color: white">label</span> will be red, whereas if student is present or has participated, then <span style="background-color: green; color: white">label</span> is green.
   * **Current session's status**: Contains the session's name and date that you are currently in. You will see "Currently not in session" if you are not in any session. This can be seen in all the tabs.
   * **Statistics**: Calculated as a percentage of the number of students that was present or has participated out of all the students. You will see nothing here if you are not in any session. This can be seen in all the tabs.

Similar to the [`Students`](#41-students) tab, if there are no students in that session, you will see a similar message as shown in **Figure 4.1.2**.

If you have not entered any session or left a session (by removing that session), you will see a message indicating as such. You can enter a session by using `enterses INDEX` as described in [Section 5.4.5 - Entering a session](#545-entering-a-session--enterses).

![NotInCurrentSessionsLayout](images/user-guide/4.3.2-NotInCurrentSessionLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.3.2</b>: Layout of `Current Session` tab when no session is entered </sub> </p>

To find out which features are supported by the `Current Session` tab, you can head over to [Section 5.5 - Current session](#55-current-session).

{ end of `layout_of_atas#current_session` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `layout_of_atas#memo` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 4.4. Memo

The following is how the `Memo` tab looks like:

![MemoLayout](images/user-guide/4.4.1-MemoLayout.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 4.4.1</b>: Layout of `Memo` tab </sub> </p>

Note:
   * **Memo box**: A text box where you can input any notes that you need for future references. The amount of space you can see is tied to size of your application window, but the actual text space that you can typed in will automatically be extended if you need more space.

To find out which features are supported by the `Memo` tab, you can head over to [Section 5.6 - Memo](#56-memo).

{ end of `layout_of_atas#memo` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Features

{ start of `features#overview` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 5.1. Overview
In this section, you can find the details of all the available features in **ATAS** such as their descriptions and formats. We have grouped the features into 7 main groups, namely [General](#52-general), [Students](#53-students), [Sessions](#54-sessions), [Current session](#55-current-session), [Memo](#56-memo), [User confirmation](#57-user-confirmation), and [Saving the data](#58-saving-the-data). 

There are 2 main types of features:
1. Commands that you can execute in the command box or through keyboard shortcut
1. Features that are already inplace and require no actions from you

With the exception of [saving the memo](#562-saving-the-memo), all commands that are available can be executed regardless of which tab you are in.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders to be replaced by you.<br>
  e.g., you should change `addstu n/STUDENT_NAME` to `addstu n/Elvin Ng`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., you can use `n/NAME [t/TAG]` as `n/Elvin Ng t/helpful` or simply as `n/Elvin Ng`.
  
* If there are multiple items in round brackets, at least one of them should be supplied.<br>
  e.g., you should use `(n/UPDATED_NAME) (e/UPDATED_EMAIL_ADDRESS)` separately as `n/Elvin Ng` / `e/elvinng@u.nus.edu` (i.e. 1 parameter), or together like `n/Elvin Ng e/elvinng@u.nus.edu`(i.e. 2 parameters).

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., you can use `[t/TAG]…​` as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/helpful`(i.e. 1 time), `t/helpful t/outspoken`(i.e. 2 times) etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER`, `m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
</div>

{ end of `features#overview` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `features#general` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

### 5.2. General

This category consists of conventional features (`help`, `exit`, `undo` and `redo`) that you can find in most applications. It also consists of features that are  responsible for navigating through **ATAS** (`switch`) and those that have no specific relation to any of the other categories below (`rng`).

{ end of `features#general` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `features#general#help` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

#### 5.2.1. Viewing help : `help`

Opens a popup window which shows the list of available commands and a link to access this user guide.

**Format:**
```
help
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
 
**:information_source: Notes about the usage of this command:**<br>
* Only a maximum of one help window can be open

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**

* `help`

</div>

**Outcome:**

1. A help window that look like the following will open up.
![HelpWindow](images/user-guide/5.2.1.1-HelpWindow.png)
    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 5.2.1.1</b>: Help window </sub> </p>

1. A message indicating a help window has been opened will be displayed in the main **ATAS** window.
![Help](images/user-guide/5.2.1.2-Help.png)
    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 5.2.1.2</b>: Main window view after opening help window </sub> </p>

{ end of `features#general#help` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

{ start of `features#general#switch` written by: Ngoh Wei Yue }

#### 5.2.2. Switching between tabs : `switch`

Switches between tabs.

**Format:**
```
switch TAB_NAME
```
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
 
**:information_source: Notes about the usage of this command:**<br>
* `TAB_NAME` is case-insensitive.
* `Current` replaces `Current Session` as `TAB_NAME` here for simplicity.
* `TAB_NAME` must be an existing tab (`ATAS`, `Students`, `Sessions`, `Current` or `Memo`).
* Switching to the same tab you are in will result in an error message.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**

* `switch sessions`

</div>

**Outcome:**

The sessions tab will be displayed.

{ start of `features#general#rng` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

#### 5.2.3. Generating the name of a randomly-selected student : `rng`

Chooses a student at random from the student list.

**Format:**
```
rng
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes about the usage of this command:** 
* The student list that **ATAS** references will be whatever list is shown on the student's tab.
   * If the full list is shown (say after [`liststu`](#533-listing-all-students--liststu)),
     then the student selected can be from anyone already in the overall student list.
   * If only a partial / no list is shown (say after [`findstu`](#532-locating-students-by-name--findstu)),
     then the student selected will be someone from that truncated list.
     If the list is empty, then an error will be shown -- there is no student to select from!

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**

* `rng`

{ end of `features#general#rng` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

{ start of `features#general#undo` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

#### 5.2.4. Undo-ing a command : `undo`

Undoes a command and essentially returns **ATAS** to the state prior to performing that command.

**Format:**
```
undo
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the usage of this command:**<br>

* An `undo` is done *per command* and not per change. If you make multiple changes to a student, for example, using a single `editstu` command, then `undo` will revert *all* the changes.
* Commands that can be undone are:
   * Adding a student/session: [`addstu`](#531-adding-a-student--addstu) / [`addses`](#541-adding-a-session--addses)
   * Deleting a student/session: [`deletestu`](#534-deleting-a-student--deletestu) / [`deleteses`](#542-deleting-a-session--deleteses)
   * Editing a student/session: [`editstu`](#535-editing-a-students-particulars--editstu) / [`editses`](#543-editing-a-session--editses)
   * Clearing all students/sessions: [`clearstu`](#536-clearing-the-student-list--clearstu) / [`clearses`](#544-clearing-the-session-list--clearses)
   * Entering a session: [`enterses`](#545-entering-a-session--enterses)
   * Toggling the participation status of students: [`participate`](#551-toggling-participation-status-of-students--participate)
   * Toggling the presence status of students: [`presence`](#552-toggling-presence-status-of-students--presence)
* Commands not stated above make no change to the application state and thus cannot be undone.
* Successive `undo` commands will bring the application state further back, until there are no more changes to `undo`.
* You cannot `undo` if there is no previous state to return to.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**<br>

The example we are about to use follows that used in [Section 5.3.4 - Deleting a student](#534-deleting-a-student--deletestu).

</div>

1. Suppose we have indeed deleted Alvin Lee from our student list. 
This change is reflected in the [students' tab](#41-students).
    ![524-undo-1](images/user-guide/5.2.4.1-Undo.png)
    <p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 5.2.4.1</b>: Application view after deleting Alvin Lee as seen in the students` tab </sub> </p>

1. However, we realise that deleting him was mistake.
He does belong to our class after all!
In this case, we can revert the deletion we have made with `undo`.
    ![524-undo-2](images/user-guide/5.2.4.2-Undo.png)

{ end of `features#general#undo` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

{ start of `features#general#redo` written by: Masagca Eris Jacey }

#### 5.2.5. Redo-ing a command : `redo`

Redoes a command that was most recently undone and returns **ATAS** to the state *after* having performed that command.

Essentially the reverse of undo-ing a command.

You can think of it as performing that very same command you have undone!

**Format:**
```
redo
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the usage of this command:**<br>

* A `redo` is done *per command* and not per change. If you undo a command that makes multiple changes (like `editstu`), then `redo` will recover *all* changes.
* If any of [the commands that support `undo`](#524-undo-ing-a-command--undo) is performed after an `undo`, then all states currently available for `redo` will be erased and you will not be able to go to those states anymore.
* You cannot `redo` if there is no forward state to go to.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**<br>

We will be following up from the same example used in [Section 5.2.4 - Undo-ing a command](#524-undo-ing-a-command--undo).

1. Suppose it seems like Alvin Lee has tricked us all this while and isn't actually our student!
This means that when we had initially deleted him from our list, it was actually the right thing to do. 
We can simply reverse the undo we have made using `redo`.

### 5.7. User confirmation

Some commands have the ability to alter the data stored in the hard disk.
**ATAS** aims to make careful decisions and further prompts user to confirm the execution of those commands.
These commands are: [`deletestu`](#534-deleting-a-student--deletestu), [`editstu`](#535-editing-a-students-particulars--editstu),[`clearstu`](#536-clearing-the-student-list--clearstu),
[`deleteses`](#542-deleting-a-session--deleteses), [`editses`](#543-editing-a-session--editses) and [`clearses`](#544-clearing-the-session-list--clearses).

:bulb: **Tip:** For your convenience, both `yes` and `y` are accepted when confirming the execution of a command while both `no` and `n` are accepted when rejecting the execution of a command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Examples:**
* `deletestu 1` is followed with the following displayed message `Delete student 1? (yes/no)`.
* `editstu 3 n/UPDATED_STUDENT_NAME` is followed with the following displayed message `Edit student 3? (yes/no)`.
* `clearstu` is followed with the following displayed message `Clear student list? (yes/no)` **(Figure 5.7-1)**.
* `deleteses 2` is followed with the following displayed message `Delete session 2? (yes/no)`.
* `editses 2 s/UPDATED_SESSION_NAME` is followed with the following displayed message `Edit session 3? (yes/no)`.
* `clearses` is followed with the following displayed message `Clear student list? (yes/no)`.
</div>

For example, confirmation of `clearstu` is shown above at [Section 5.3.6 - Clearing the student list](#536-clearing-the-student-list--clearstu).
In this case, we will show an example of the confirmation prompt following the `clearstu` command **(Figure 5.7-1)** and result of rejecting a `clearstu` command **(Figure 5.7-2)**.

**Format:**
```
clearstu
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**

* `clearstu` followed by `no` results in no removal of students from the student list.

### 5.8. Saving the data

`Students`, `Sessions` and `Memo` data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. This includes typing directly into the memo box. There is no need to save manually. However, you can also choose to manually save the `Memo` data if you want as described in [Section 5.6.2 - Saving the memo](#562-saving-the-memo) for that extra assurance!

The following are the names of the files that contains the respective data:

|Data |File name |
|-----|------------|
|Students' particulars | `studentlist.json` |
|Sessions' details including the students' presence and participation records  | `sessionlist.json` |
|Text in memo box | ` memo.txt` |

You can find all the three files in the `data` folder located in the same directory as your `atas.jar` file.
