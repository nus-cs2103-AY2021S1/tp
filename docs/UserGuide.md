*  `edit 2 q/What is the heart t/` Edits the question of the 2nd Q&A to be `What is the heart` and clears all existing tags.

### Finding questions/answers/tags by keywords: `find` (by: Yong Ming Yang)

> **Tip**
>
> `PHRASE` refer to words with spacing, for example: Nervous System

If you would like to search the database, you can do so in a few ways:

1. Find Q&A with **questions** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find q/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD1`

2. Find Q&A with **answers** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD1`

3. Find Q&A with **tags** containing any of the given keywords. 
   Keywords for tags can also have phrases, however this requires the text to have an exact match (case-insensitive).

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD1`

4. Find Q&A with **questions or answers** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD1`


Examples:
* `find q/system, disease` - finds questions containing the word "system" and/or "disease".
* `find a/vessels, chronic disease` - finds answers containing the word vessels, and/or the phrase "chronic disease".
* `find t/anatomy, Nervous System` - finds question sets tagged with the word "anatomy" and/or "Nervous System" (can be both), requires exact match of words (case-insensitive).
* `find infection, nervous system` - finds question and/or answers containing the word infection, and/or the phrase "nervous system"
