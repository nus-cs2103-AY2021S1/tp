## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of **Homerce**!

Are you an independent home-based beauty salon owner, scrambling between your calendar, client contacts, 
and notebook to keep track of all your appointments, revenue and expenses? 
Do you spend hours tabulating all your revenue and expenses just to get an idea of how your business is doing?
Fret not, our application, Homerce, will reduce the hassle of managing your business and save your valuable time. 
Homerce is an all-in-one application that helps home-based beauty salon owners consolidate their business details - 
such as their appointments, revenue and expenses - into a single application. 

The application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands 
into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can operate the application faster than other Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

If you are interested, jump to [Section 2 - Quick Start](#2-quick-start) to learn how to start managing your business using Homerce.

1. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied<br>
    - In `deletesvc s/SERVICE_CODE`, `SERVICE_CODE` is a parameter and the command can be used as `deletesvc s/SC001`.

2. Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    - `v/VALUE [t/TAG]` can be used as `v/15.00 t/equipment` or as `v/15.00`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Since Homerce is optimized for CLI-based usage, it is recommended to rely purely on CLI commands rather than using a
mouse to navigate between the different managers of Homerce. For example, it is better to do `listapt` rather than clicking
on the appointments tab as `listapt` will sort appointments by chronological order if there are changes made by previous commands.

### 4.5 Expense Tracker (Done by Tan Yan Lyn)

Homerce understands that expense tracking is essential in managing your business expenditure.
Thus, this feature allows you to track your expenses seamlessly and with ease. <br><br>
Our expense tracker supports both fixed expenses that recur monthly, and one-time expenses that are incurred only once.
A fixed expense only has to be added to the tracker once, as Homerce will automatically record the same fixed expense for you every month.
<br><br> You can record the following information about your expenses: `DESCRIPTION`, `IS_FIXED`, `VALUE`, `DATE` and `TAG`.

#### 4.5.1. Expense Tracker Command Parameters

Before you dive into using the feature, you may want to have a look at the common parameters used in this feature.
The table below shows a list of command parameters that will be used.

| Parameter Name | Description | Example
|---------|---------|---------
|`DESCRIPTION`  | The description of the expense. <br><br> It must be one or more alphanumeric words or special characters not more than 50 characters long in total. | E.g. Typing `Conditioner` as the description indicates that the expense was made on a bottle of Conditioner.
|`IS_FIXED`| The indication of whether an expense is fixed. <br> <br> It must be in the format of `y` or `n`. <br><br> *Note: A fixed expense is an expense that recurs monthly. For example, the monthly air-conditioning bill is a fixed expense as it recurs every month, while a box of tissues is a one-time expense and should not be indicated as fixed.* | E.g. Typing `y` would mean the expense is fixed. <br>You only have to add a fixed expense to the tracker once, as Homerce will automatically record the same expense for you every month. <br> <br> E.g. Typing `n` would mean the expense is not fixed.
|`VALUE` | The value refers to the monetary value of the expense. <br> <br> It must be a positive number above 0.00 and below 1,000,000.00 and must have two decimal places. | E.g. Typing `10.00` would mean the expense costs $10.00.
|`DATE` | The date of the expense. <br> <br> It must be a valid date in the format of `dd-MM-yyyy`. A valid year is any year from 0001 to 9999. | E.g. Typing `28-09-2020` would mean the expense was made on 28 September 2020.
|`TAG` | The tag you want to attach to the expense. <br> <br> It must be a single alphanumeric word not more than 30 characters long. <br><br> *Note: Tags are used to categorize and organize your expenses. For example, an expense on eyelash glue can be tagged under 'lashsupplies'.<br> Tags are optional, and expenses without a tag specified will automatically be categorized under 'others'.*| E.g. Typing `equipment` would mean that the expense is tagged as an equipment.
|`INDEX` | The index of the expense in the displayed list. <br> <br> It must be a valid index number. | E.g. Typing `2` would refer to the expense with the second index in the displayed list.
|`ORDER` | The order refers to ascending or descending. <br> <br> It must be in the format of `asc` or `desc`. <br><br> *Note: Order is used in the `sortexp` command, to indicate whether you want the list to be sorted from lowest to highest value (ascending), or from highest to lowest value (descending).*| E.g. Typing `asc` would mean ascending. Expenses will be displayed from lowest to highest value. <br> <br> E.g. Typing `desc` would mean descending. Expenses will be displayed from highest to lowest value.

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: How do I create a Revenue in Homerce? <br>
**A**: Unfortunately, Homerce does not allow you to directly create a revenue. A Revenue will only be created when an appointment
is marked as done.

**Q**: What is the `IS_FIXED` parameter in the Expense Tracker for? <br>
**A**: Marking an expense as 'Fixed' indicates to Homerce that the particular expense is fixed and recurs every month. Homerce
will automatically add the same expense to your list of expenses every month. 

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: By default, Homerce saves all your data in a folder named `data` in the same directory as the application. 
You can copy and transfer the data folder into the same directory as Homerce on your other computer and Homerce will automatically load your data for you.
