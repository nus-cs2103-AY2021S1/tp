# User Guide for Taskmania

Taskmania (based off AB3) is a **desktop app for a project leader to manage team members and tasks** to be finished in a
 software project, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
 Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Taskmania can allow you to manage your team faster than 
 a traditional point and click interface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1 Quick start

1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `Taskmania.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TaskMania.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The window that appears will be similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how
 the app contains some sample information.<br>

   *Figure 1: A view of Taskmania at startup*

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
 open the help window.<br>
   Some commands you can try:

   * **`startproject 1`** : Opens the first project

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app

6. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* One and only one item in parenthesis should be supplied by the user
  e.g. `(ta/ASSIGNEE_GIHUB_USERNAME)||(td/DEADLINE)` can be used as "ta/Alice98" or "td/31-12-2020 10:00:00", but not as "ta/Alice98 td/31-12-2020 10:00:00" or "".

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [tg/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tg/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tg/friend`, `tg/friend tg/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

**:information_source: Notes about scoping:**<br>

Each command has a restriction on the scope that it can be run. 
Scopes include `PROJECT_LIST`, `PERSON_LIST`, `PROJECT`, `PERSON`, `TASK`, `TEAMMATE`.
The hierarchy of command scoping is as follows:
* global
    * `PROJECT_LIST` 
      * `PROJECT`
        * `TASK` 
        * `TEAMMATE`
    * `PERSON_LIST`
      * `PERSON`

<br>

A command may be valid in some scopes or another. For example, `startperson ` command can only be run under
`PERSON_LIST` or `PERSON` scope, otherwise there will be an exception.
The hierarchy list is above only aims to give you an overview of the meanings of the scopes, 
and in most cases a command that is valid in a parent scope would be valid in any descendant scopes, but may not always be true.

The scope can be told from the user interface as follows: 

Scope | Left panel | Middle panel | Right panel
--------|------------------|-------|----------
`PROJECT_LIST` | project list | empty | empty
`PERSON_LIST` | person list | empty | empty
`PROJECT` | project list | project dashboard | empty
`PERSON` | person list | person dashboard | empty
`TASK` | project list | project dashboard | task dashboard
`TEAMMATE` | project list | project dashboard | teammate dashboard
