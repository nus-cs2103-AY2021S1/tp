## Introduction
Welcome to ProductiveNUS User Guide! :blue_book:

**ProductiveNUS is a desktop application** made for you, **a School of Computing (SoC) student in National University of Singapore (NUS)**, to **manage and schedule your academic tasks more effectively**. It makes use of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, which provides you with an intuitive interface and immediate visual feedback. ProductiveNUS uses a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**; this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a [Command Box](#gui-terminologies). If you are fast at typing, you can manage your academic tasks more efficiently.

As a **student from the SoC in NUS**, you tend to have a **heavy workload**. ProductiveNUS helps **improve your productivity** by **enhancing your organisational skills**. Apart from simply **keeping track of your tasks**, ProductiveNUS is capable of **scheduling** them for you so you will never **miss any deadlines**. ProductiveNUS is also compatible with NUSMods, meaning all your **timetable information can be imported easily** into the application so all your academic tasks can be found in just one application.

### Command syntax

All commands and their examples are demarcated with `markups`. `Markups` appear as a grey box as shown.

### Date and time format

All commands with date and/or time parameters have a specific format you must follow, else your input will be deemed as invalid.

#### Date

Date parameters must be in the format `dd-MM-yyyy`, where `dd` is day of the month, `MM` is month and `yyyy` is year. The number of repeated letters indicate the number of digits required for day of the month, month and year. 

For example, `dd` means that the day of the month has to be a 2-digit number. Hence, for dates you want to input from the 1st to the 9th of any month, you must key in `09-01-2020`. `9-01-2020` will be deemed as invalid.

Likewise for month and year, `09-1-2020` and `09-01-20` will be deemed as invalid.

#### Time

Time parameters must be in the format `HHmm`, where `HH` is the hour of the day and `mm` is the minute of the hour. You must input the time according to the 24-hour clock system.

For example, 7:00 AM is `0700` while 7:00 PM is `1900`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:clipboard: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT`, `NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Assignment 2`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT [remind]` can be used as `n/Assignment 2 remind` or as `n/Assignment 2`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT d/DEADLINE`, `d/DEADLINE n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT` is also acceptable.
  
* All instances of `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**.<br>
  e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​

</div>

### Adding an assignment: `add`

Format: `add n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT d/DEADLINE_OF_ASSIGNMENT TIME_ASSIGNMENT_IS_DUE mod/MODULE​[p/PRIORITY] 
[remind]`

You can add your assignments into your schedule so that you can manage all your assignments and
 academic tasks conveniently. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Tip:**
You can include `remind` when adding an assignment instead of using the `remind` command to set reminders after adding an assignment.
</div>

For example, to add a lab report assignment that is **due** on 23th April 2020 12.30pm and **associated** with the module CS2100, you can 
simply enter `add n/Lab report d/23-04-2020 1230 mod/CS2100`. All the information of the assignment will be displayed as shown in the labelled diagram below.

You can find assignments with multiple keywords of the same type to widen your search!
</div>

This is the table of prefixes used:

| Prefix | Syntax | Example |
|-|-|-|
| `n/` | n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT | - `n/Tutorial` |
| `mod/` | mod/MODULE_CODE | - `mod/ST2334` |
| `d/` | d/DATE_OR_TIME_OF_ASSIGNMENT | - `d/24-10-2020 1300` |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

 **:clipboard: Pointers to note for prefixes and keywords:**<br>
* For prefix `d/`, date keywords are **irrespective of time** and time keywords are **irrespective of date**. For example, `find d/1300 25-11-2020` finds all assignments due on 25-11-2020, at any time of the day and all assignments due at 1300, on any date.
* Keywords used with prefixes `n/`,`mod/` and `p/` are **case-insensitive**.
</div>

Here is an example with steps to follow:

1) To find assignments from the modules CS2100 and ST2334, you can simply key in `find mod/CS2100 ST2334`.

### Automated features and enhancements
#### Upcoming tasks
Your `Upcoming tasks` are updated in real time.

If the current time is pass the **deadline of an assignment or the end time of a lesson**, ProductiveNUS **automatically removes** the assignment or lesson from `Upcoming tasks`.

As such, you do not need to worry about manually updating your `Upcoming tasks` as you will receive accurate information of your academic schedule in real time.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
 **:clipboard: Pointers to note:**<br>
Only assignments with deadlines **before** the current time and lessons with end time **before** the current time if displayed in `Upcoming tasks`. For example, if the deadline of an assignment has time `2359`, when the current time changes from `2358` to `2359`, the assignment will automatically be removed from `Upcoming tasks`.
</div>

#### Remarks on deadline of assignments and start time of lessons
You can easily view how much time you have left before your assignment is due and when your lessons start. As such, you can better plan out your time to ensure you have enough time to complete your assignments and attend your lessons on time.

For your assignments and lessons, assignments due in **more than a week's time** will be displayed in white, while assignments that are **overdue** or due in **less than a week's time** will be displayed in red (Figure 29).  
 ![AutoDiagram](images/AutoDiagram.png)
   *Figure 29: Hours or days due for assignments and lessons*
                 
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
 **:clipboard: Pointers to note:**<br>
Unlike your `Upcoming tasks`, the remarks are currently not updated in real time. As such, the remarks displayed is the time you have left from when you open ProductiveNUS. Only when you interact with the assignments (clicking or using the commands to alter the assignment list) will the remarks get updated.
<br>Do look forward to the next version of ProductiveNUS to have your remarks updated in real time!
