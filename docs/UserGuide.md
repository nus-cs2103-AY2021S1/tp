## 1. Introduction

Welcome to User Guide for our application, Covigent! Has Covid-19 hit your boutique hotel hard and left you scrambling to search for an application
that can ease your transition from a boutique hotel to a quarantine facility? Your search ends here! 

Covigent is a desktop management application to ease boutique hotels' transitions into quarantine facilities. Covigent aims to help boutique hotel managers
keep track of the information of quarantined individuals (i.e. patients) and the tasks to be done by their staff. The main features include:<br>

      1. Managing patient information - Period of Stay, temperature, phone number etc.<br>
      2. Managing the rooms of the quarantine facility - Allocate patients to rooms, search for a room, etc.<br>
      3. Managing the tasks to be done by each room - Add a task to a room, editing a task to the room, etc.<br>

As an application optimized for use with a keyboard rather than the mouse, you operate Covigent mainly by 
typing commands into a Command Box. If you can type quickly, Covigent can improve your efficiency in managing your patients and tasks instead of using traditional apps.
But wait! Don't forget our beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI) too!
With our easy to navigate GUI, it has served it's purpose well as an interface that facilitates interaction with our application
through graphical icons. 

Getting interested? Jump to [Section 3, "Getting Started"](#3-getting-started) to get started.

This is what Covigent looks like:

## 3. Getting Started

If you are tired of lengthy and problematic installation processes, Covigent is perfect for you.
The setup is minimal and can be completed in 4 simple steps. Follow the instructions below to try it out!

### 3.1 Setting Up

The following steps to set up Covigent are applicable to Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

1. Install Java 11 or a later version. The latest version of Java can be found [here](https://java.com/en/download/).

1. Download the latest version of Covigent from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/releases). To do so, look for the file `covigent.jar` and click on it.
    Please refer to Figure 2 if you require assistance with locating the file. Figure 2 shows how to download version 1.3 of Covigent. `covigent.jar` has been highlighted in red for your convenience.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/ug/f2_downloadcovigent.png" width="500" height="230">
        <br />
        <i>Figure 2. How to Download Covigent</i>
    </p>

1. You may move `covigent.jar` to any other folder. Your save data and preferences for Covigent will be saved to the same folder.

1. Double-click on `covigent.jar` to start Covigent. Here is what you will see if everything goes right:
<p align="center">
        <img src="images/ug/f3_startingcovigent.png" width="400" height="300">
        <br />
        <i>Figure 3. Covigent after Starting Up</i>
    </p>

In case there are any problems during setup, please refer to [Section 7, "FAQ"](#7-faq) for instructions to resolve them.

### 3.2 Parts of the Graphical User Interface

The user interface of Covigent comprises 3 main tabs: Patients, Rooms, and Tasks. The tabs respectively display information on the
patients, the rooms in the quarantine facility, and the tasks assigned to the rooms. A tab turns a deeper shade of pink
when you click on it to indicate that you are currently in the tab. For example, Figure 4 shows how the Tasks tab changes colours when you click on it.
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ug/f4_covigenttabs.png" width="100" height="300">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 4. User Interface of Covigent when a Tab is Clicked</i>
</p>

#### 3.2.1 Patients Tab

The main purpose of the Patients tab is to display information about the patients.

When you first start Covigent, you will find yourself in the Patients tab. You may notice that there is already some sample data for quarantined
individuals. There is no need to worry! The data can be edited or deleted to suit your needs later. If you urgently need to change the data,
please proceed to [Section 5.2.3, "Edit Patient Details"](#523-edit-patient-details-editpatient) for the relevant instructions.

Using the Patients tab is easy. Click on any of the patients. This will highlight that individual and display her information.
Figure 5 illustrates what happens when you click on a patient _David Li_. Observe that his details appear on the right of the
user interface, in the Details Panel.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ug/f5_patientstab.png" width="600" height="280">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 5. Highlighted Individual in Patients Tab</i>
</p>

#### 3.2.2 Rooms Tab

The main purpose of the Rooms tab is to display information about the rooms in the quarantine facility. Each room contains 1 quarantined
individual and multiple tasks.

When you first start Covigent and click into the Rooms tab, it will be empty. Rest assured that this is normal. Once you learn how to add rooms
to Covigent, the Rooms tab will be populated in no time. You may refer to [Section 3.3, "Tutorial on How to Use Covigent"](#33-tutorial-on-how-to-use-covigent)
for step-by-step guidance or [Section 5.3.1, "Initialise Rooms in Hotel"](#531-initialise-rooms-in-hotel-initroom) if you prefer a more hands-on approach.

Using the Rooms tab is easy. Click on any of the rooms. This will highlight that room and display the patient and tasks allocated
to the room. Figure 6 shows what happens when you click on _Room #2_. The details of the patient _Alex Yeoh_ and task _Sanitise the room_ 
are displayed on the right of the user interface, in the Details Panel.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ug/f6_roomstab.png" width="600" height="280">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 6. Highlighted Room in Rooms Tab</i>
</p>

#### 3.2.3 Tasks Tab

The main purpose of the Tasks tab is to display information about the tasks assigned to the rooms. When you have too many tasks, it is common
to forget which room you have allocated a certain task to. The Tasks tab provides a quick overview of all the tasks in Covigent such that you do not
have to look through each room to find a specific task.

When you first start Covigent and click into the Tasks tab, it will be empty. Do not panic! This is the default behaviour. As you add more tasks to the rooms,
those tasks will start to appear in the Tasks tab. You may refer to [Section 3.3, "Tutorial on How to Use Covigent"](#33-tutorial-on-how-to-use-covigent)
for step-by-step guidance or [Section 5.4.1, "Add a Task to a Room"](#541-add-a-task-to-a-room-addtask) if you prefer a more hands-on approach.

Using the Tasks tab is easy. Simply read the description and due date of the tasks directly from the user interface. For tasks with very long
descriptions, the user interface is unable to fully display them. In those cases, you may highlight the descriptions with your cursor and drag right to scroll through them.
Alternatively, you may triple-click on the descriptions, followed by a right click to copy them. Refer to Figure 7 for an example of the latter method.

    <i>Figure 7. Copying a Long Description in Tasks Tab</i>
</p>

### 3.3 Tutorial on How to Use Covigent

Covigent has numerous features, including adding patients, creating rooms, assigning tasks to rooms, and more.
Every feature has a corresponding command. Using a feature is as simple as typing a command in the Command Box (see Figure 8) and pressing Enter to execute it.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ug/f8_commandbox.png" width="800" height="100">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 8. Command Box of Covigent</i>
</p>

You have heard so much about the potential of Covigent. Excited? Without further ado, let's give these features a try! We will role-play the
following scenario to get you acquainted with a few common commands: your hotel has 10 rooms; a guest is arriving today and will quarantine with
your hotel for 14 days; and you must not forget to sanitise the room the day after he leaves.

You may copy-and-paste the following commands (bold and in grey highlights) into the Command Box. Do not forget to press Enter, or the command will not execute!

1. **`initroom 10`** : Let's set up the hotel room first. This command creates _10_ rooms in Covigent. If you proceed to the Rooms tab, you will see that 10 rooms
   have been created (see Figure 9).

    <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ug/f9_initroomexample.png" width="500" height="400">
       <br />
       <i>Figure 9. Creating Hotel Rooms in Covigent</i>
    </p>

2. **`addpatient n/John Doe t/37.4 d/20200910-20200924 p/98765432 a/35 c/Vegan`** : The guest has arrived. You have taken his temperature and need to enter his details into Covigent.
   This command adds a new patient named _John Doe_ with age _35_, phone number _98765432_, period of stay _10 Sep 2020 to 24 Sep 2020_, temperature _37.4_, and a comment that he is _Vegan_.
   If you proceed to the Patients tab, you will see that _John Doe's_ entry has been added.

    <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ug/f10_addpatientexample.png" width="500" height="400">
       <br />
       <i>Figure 10. Adding a Patient to Covigent</i>
    </p>

3. **`findemptyroom`** : You would like to assign _John Doe_ a room but are unsure which rooms are empty. This command will search for an empty room.
   Proceed to the Rooms tab. The result can be seen in Figure 11.

    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/ug/f11_findemptyroomexample.png" width="500" height="400">
        <br />
        <i>Figure 11. Finding an Empty Room in Covigent</i>
    </p>

4. **`allocateroom 1 n/John Doe`** : Now that you know _Room #1_ is empty, let's assign _Room #1_ to _John Doe_. This command will do exactly that.
   Notice that _Room #1_ is now occupied and _John Doe's_ details are reflected in the Details Panel on the right of the user interface.

    <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ug/f12_allocateroomexample.png" width="500" height="400">
       <br />
       <i>Figure 12. Allocating a Room to a Patient in Covigent</i>
    </p>

5. **`addtask r/1 d/Sanitise the room dd/20200925 1800`** : Finally, we would like a reminder to sanitise the room after _John Doe_ leaves.
   This command adds a task to _Room #1_ with description _Sanitise the room_ and due date _25 Sep 2020 1800_. Notice that the Details Panel
   reflects the task now (see Figure 12). You may also click on the Tasks tab to view the newly added task.

    <p align="center">

## 5. Features

This section covers all the commands that you can type into the Command Box of Covigent. The commands are categorised into [patient features](#52-patient), [room features](#53-room) and [task features](#54-task). If it is the first time that you are using the command, we recommend that you refer to [Command Format](#51-command-format) to find out how to interpret the format of the commands.

_Written by: Yun Qing_

### 5.1 Command Format

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:** <br />
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields to be supplied by the user. <br />
  e.g. in `addpatient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a field which can be used as `addpatient n/John Doe`.

* Fields in square brackets are optional. <br />
  e.g `n/NAME [c/COMMENT]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/Is vegan` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Fields can be in any order. <br />
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If the same field is provided multiple times, only the last input for that field will be processed.<br />
  e.g. if you input `n/John Doe n/Mary Doe`, Covigent will only process `n/Mary Doe` and ignore `n/John Doe`. Similarly, if you input `n/John Doe t/37.4 n/Mary Doe t/36.5`, Covigent will interpret the fields provided as simply `n/Mary Doe t/36.5`.


### 5.2 Patient

This section contains all the commands related to patients. You can [add](#521-add-a-patient-addpatient), [delete](#522-delete-a-patient-deletepatient),
