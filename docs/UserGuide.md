1. Copy the jar to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SupperStrikers.

1. Open a command window. Run the java -version command to ensure you are using Java 11. If not, please install Java 11 to ensure you are able to safely launch the jar file.

1. Launch the jar file using the java -jar supperstrikers.jar command (do not use double-clicking). The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`vendor`** : List all the vendors available.
   * **`vendor 1`** : Select the first vendor to make a supper order for.
   * **`add 1 2`** : Adds two quantity of the item at the 1st index from the vendor's menu to your supper order.

## Features

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `find KEYWORD`, `KEYWORD` is a parameter which can be used as `find spicy`.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  E.g `add INDEX [QUANTITY]` can be used as `add 3 2` or as `add 3`.
  
* **Friendly syntax** is supported! For any command, typing the prefix of the command will already be recognized, unless there is any ambiguity. 

  * E.g. `help` only requires the user to type `h` to be recognized, while `sort` will require user to at least type `so` since typing `s` by itself will conflict with another command `submit` (The commands
  will be explained below. To minimize confusion, the whole command will be shown instead of the prefix.)
  
* Extra whitespaces in between arguments will be ignored.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
**A**: Overwrite your current data file with your old data file.

**Q**: Why are some pictures missing on the menu?
**A**: These are intended as an example of what is shown if vendors lack a picture for a menu item.

**Q**: Why am I not allowed to add vendors or menu items?
**A**: We realised that allowing users to add vendors or menu items from the command line is unfeasible, as each vendor will have many menu items, and it would be extremely time-consuming for the user. However, the user is able to manually add vendors or menu items in the json file, but the user must ensure that all details are included correctly.
