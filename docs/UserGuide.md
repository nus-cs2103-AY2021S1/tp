## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `cap5buddy.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ Cap 5 Buddy application.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. <br>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addtask n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addtask n/Week 11 quiz`.

* Items in square brackets are optional. Items without square brackets are compulsory fields. <br>
  e.g. `addtask n/NAME [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `addtask n/Week 11 quiz p/highest` or as `addtask n/Week 11 quiz`
  
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. <br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/easy`, `t/friend t/important` etc.
  
* Argument parameters can be provided in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `addtask n/NAME [p/PRIORITY]`, `addtask [p/PRIORITY] n/NAME` is also acceptable.  
  
* If you enter duplicate parameters when the command format does not expect multiple occurrence of the same parameter, i.e. 
  parameters without `...` at the back in the command format (e.g. n/NAME), the application will only consider the argument of the last 
  occurring duplicate parameter. 
  e.g. in `addtask n/Week 11 quiz n/Lab assignment`, `n/Week 11 quiz` will be ignored and a task with the name `Lab assignment` will be added.

</div>


### Module Features

#### Adding a new module: `addmodule`

Creates and add a new module to be stored in the system.

  Format: `addmodule` `n/MODULE_NAME`
  
  * You can only key in the module code for the `MODULE_NAME`.
  
  * The module code you input must be **capitalised**, eg. `cs2103t` will be rejected while `CS2103T` is correct.
   
   Example:
   * `addmodule CS2103T` creates and add the module CS2103T with no zoom link.


#### Viewing a module: `viewmodule`

Views a module stored in the system.

 Format: `viewmodule` `INDEX`

  * The module viewed will be at the `INDEX` position of the current displayed list.
  
  * The index refers to the index number of the module shown on the displayed module list. 
  
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3...

  Examples:
   * `viewmodule 1` views the first module in the displayed list.

#### Adding a zoom link for a specific lesson to a module: `addzoom`

Adds a zoom link for a specific lesson to an existing module.

  Format: `addzoom INDEX n/LESSON_NAME z/ZOOM_LINK`
  
   * Adds a zoom link to the module at the specified `INDEX`. 
   
   * The index refers to the index number of the module shown on the displayed module list. 
   
   * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3...
   
   * The zoom link provided must be a link that uses the NUS domain. A typical zoom link that is under the NUS domain
     would start with: `https://nus-sg.zoom.us/`. Zoom links that do not belong to the NUS domain would not be accepted.

  Example:
  `addzoom 1 n/lecture z/https://nus-sg.zoom.us/j/auya7164hg` Adds a zoom link `https://nus-sg.zoom.us/j/auya7164hg` to the first module
   in the displayed module list for the lesson `lecture`.
  

#### Deleting a module: `deletemodule`

Deletes a module in the displayed module list.

 Format: `deletemodule` `INDEX`
 
   * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3...
   
   * The index refers to the index number of the module shown on the displayed module list. 
   
  Examples:
  * `deletemodule 1` deletes the module at position `1`

#### Editing a module : `editmodule`

Edits an existing module in the displayed module list with new details.

 Format: `editmodule` `INDEX` `[n/MODULE_NAME]` `[mc/MODULAR_CREDITS]` `[gp/GRADE_POINT]` `[t/TAG]...`

  * Edits the details of the module at position `INDEX` with the optional fields listed.
  
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3...
  
  * At least **one** of the optional fields `[MODULE_NAME]`, `[MODULAR_CREDITS]` or `[GRADE_POINT]` must be present.

  * You can add `[TAG]`s to a module through this command,eg. `Tutorial`.
  
 Examples:
  * `editmodule 1 n/CS2030` edits the `MODULE_NAME` for a module at index `1` to `CS2030`.
  
  * `editmodule 3 mc/8 gp/4.5` edits the `MODULAR_CREDITS` and `GRADE_POINT` for the module at index `3` to `8.0` 
  modular credits and the grade points to `4.5`.
  
 To be implemented:
  * We are working on adding the functionality to edit the zoom links for the module for each lesson. 


#### Adding assignment to a module: `addassignment`

  Adds an assignment to an existing module.

  Format: `addassignment` `n/MODULE_NAME` `a/ASSIGNMENT_NAME` `%/ASSIGNMENT_PERCENTAGE` `r/ASSIGNMENT_RESULT`

  * Adds an assignment `ASSIGNMENT_NAME` to a module `MODULE_NAME`
   
  * The assignment takes up a percentage of the final grade, `ASSIGNMENT_PERCENTAGE`.
  
  * Your `ASSIGNMENT_RESULT` must be converted to a decimal from `0.00 - 1.00`

  Example of usage:
  `addassignment n/CS2100 a/Quiz 1 %/5 r/0.80` adds an assignment called `Quiz 1` to the module `CS2100`. `Quiz 1` 
  carries `5`% of the final grade and the result for this assignment is `80/100`.
  
#### Editing an assignment in a module: `editassignment`

  Edits an assignment at the specified position in the specified module. 

  Format: `editassignment` `INDEX` `n/MODULE_NAME` `[a/ASSIGNMENT_NAME]` `[%/ASSIGNMENT_PERCENTAGE]` 
  `[r/ASSIGNMENT_RESULT]`
  
  * The fields that can be edited are the `ASSIGNMENT_NAME`, `ASSIGNMENT_PERCENTAGE` of the final grade 
  and `ASSIGNMENT_RESULT`.
  
  * At least **one** of the optional fields must be present.
  
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3...
  
  * Your new `ASSIGNMENT_RESULT` must be converted to a decimal from `0.00 - 1.00`

  Example of usage:
   `editassignment 1 n/CS2100 a/Quiz 1` edits the assignment at position `1` of the module `CS2100` with a new 
   assignment name, `Quiz 1`. 
   `editassignment 1 n/CS2100 %/20 r/0.80` edits the assignment at position `1` of the module `CS2100` with a new 
   assignment percentage, `20`% of the final grade, and a new assignment result, `0.80`.   


### Todo List Features

Todo List can store all of your tasks that you need to complete. Before you start learning how to use the commands
for Todo List, you should first understand the details of a task.

#### What is a Task ? : `Task`
