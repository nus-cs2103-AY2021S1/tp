## Introduction
**ResiReg** (**Res**idential **Reg**ulation) is a productivity app designed to help admin staff at Residential Colleges (RCs)* in NUS with their daily tasks. ResiReg allows admin to allocate rooms to students, manage students records, generate billing and OHS reports, and export CSVs for easy reference and sharing.
 
 **ResiReg** has the following main features:
 
 * Manage records of students.
 * Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College
 * Export records of students, rooms or transactions to CSV files for easy reference and sharing.

__ResiReg__ is optimised for OHS who are fast typists who are used to MS Excel, and prefer typing over other means of input. It comes with:
- A Command Line Interface (CLI) which allows you to access all __ResiReg__ features by typing.
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that displays the information you need in a grid format.

> __ResiReg__ is currently a work in progress. Here is a mockup of its skeleton. Stay tuned for our progress!

## About this Guide
### Basic Information
This User Guide explains how you (as an OHS admin) can use __ResiReg__ to manage tasks at Residential Colleges.

You may refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start) for a short tutorial on how to run __ResiReg__ on your system and use __ResiReg__'s main features. For a full walkthrough of __ResiReg__, please refer to [Features](#features).

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that Java 11 or above is installed in your computer
2. Download the latest `ResiReg.jar` here.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **ResiReg**.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The following window should appear within a few seconds - this is the Session Screen, where you can create, open, or delete interview sessions:
5. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open this user guide.
6. Some example commands you can try:
    -  `rooms --vacant`: lists all rooms that are vacant.
    - `allocate A0123456X 08-108`: allocate a student with the student ID A0123456X to room number 08-108.
    - `exit`: exits the app.
8. Refer to “Features” for details of all the commands.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
This section explains the format of commands in this User Guide.

- Words in `<angular_brackets>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `deallocate <student_name>`, `<student_name>` is a parameter which can be used as `deallocate Jet New`.
- Items in square brackets are optional e.g `<full_name> [-aka <alias>]` can be used as `Jet New -aka JJ` or as `Jet New`.
- Items separated by <Code>|</Code> indicates a choice between items, but only one item is to be used at any time e.g. in `rooms --vacant` or `rooms --allocated`.
- Items with … after them can be used multiple times including zero times, unless otherwise stated e.g. `[/m <mod> /ig <interest_group>]…` can be used as `/m mod /ig ig`, `/m mod1 /ig ig1 /m mod2 /ig ig2` etc.

Format: `allocate ri/<room_index> si/<student_index>`
* Allocates a room to the student person at the specified `room_index` and `student_index`. The `room_index` refers to the index number shown in the displayed rooms list, 
and the `student_index` refers to the index number shown in the displayed students list. Both indices **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Both the student and the room must be unallocated when this command is run. Otherwise, an error message is displayed accordingly.

Format: `deallocate ri/<room_index> si/<student_index>`
* Deallocates a room to the student at the specified `room_index` and `student_index`. The `room_index` refers to the index number shown in the displayed rooms list, 
and the `student_index` refers to the index number shown in the displayed students list. Both indices **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, …​

#### 6. Edit a room allocation for a student : `reallocate`

Edits a room allocation for a student, by first deallocating the student's current room, and then allocating a specified room to the student.

* The room at `room_index` must currently be vacant. Otherwise, an error message is displayed accordingly. 

Examples:
* `reallocate si/1 ri/2` first deallocates the room currently allocated to student with index 1, then  allocates the room at index 2 to the student.

#### 7. Archiving a Semester

Archives the previous semester's data into an archival folder, and adjusts the application to operate on the succeeding semester. 

Format: `archive`

* Moves the previous semester's allocation data to `AY[YEAR]S[SEMESTER]/archive.json`. For example, if the previous semester was 2019 Semester 2, the allocation data will be moved to `AY2019S2/archive.json`.

* The student ID must be a unique 8-digit alphanumeric string, starting with `EO` and ending with 6 digits. Otherwise, an error message is displayed accordingly.
* The pairs of type-prefixes and data (eg. `n/<student_name>`) may given be in any order. 
* The student will not be added if some pieces of information is missing. An error message will be displayed instead.

email is jn@u.nus.edu, and faculty is Computing (SOC). 
* `add student n/Jet New i/E0407889 e/jn@u.nus.edu` prompts the user with the following error message (because the faculty field is missing): 
        ```
        Invalid command format!
