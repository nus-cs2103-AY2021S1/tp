## 1. Overview
(Contributed by Wen Hao)

Welcome to the NUSave User Guide! In this section, you will be given an overview of what NUSave is about
and what you can get out of reading this document.

### 1.1. Introduction
(Contributed by Wen Hao)

Are you a **university student who stays on campus** and has difficulty managing your expenses?
Are you tired of having to look through countless spreadsheets and memos just to figure out how much you have spent this month?
Do you wish there exists a desktop application that can help you organise, track and manage all your expenses?

Look no further, NUSave is just the tool for you!

Built by 5 university students staying on campus, we understand **the difficulties of having to manage multiple budgets**,
be it for your daily expenses, school projects or club activities, amidst your busy schedule. NUSave aims to help alleviate
the hassle that comes along with managing multiple budgets by providing a one-stop solution to all your problems.

With NUSave, you can create, edit and delete [budgets](#7-glossary) and [expenditures](#7-glossary), as well as generate statistics
based on your entries to gain useful insights regarding your spending habits.

What's more, NUSave has:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

- a **[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#7-glossary)** catered to those who can type fast and prefer to use a keyboard. In other words, you
navigate the application and execute instructions by keying in text-based commands into the [command box](#3-gui-layout) provided.
- a **[Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#7-glossary)** to provide you with a visually appealing and aesthetic user experience. Essentially,
the current status of the application is reflected live on-screen so what you see is what you get!

### 1.2. Purpose
(Contributed by Wen Hao)

The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide for new users on how to get started with NUSave as well as
to provide a detailed reference for veteran users on how to use the different commands that are available within NUSave.

## 2. About the User Guide

In this section, you will learn what the different symbols and notations (that can be found in this user guide) mean.

### 2.1. Symbols
(Contributed by Yu Ming)

When reading this user guide, various symbols may appear occasionally to draw your attention to important information.
The meaning for each symbol is as follows:

Symbol | Meaning 
-------| ------------ 
 ⚠️    | This symbol indicates that there is something important for you to take note of.
 📕    | This symbol indicates that there is additional information you may find useful.
 ✏️   | This symbol indicates that an example is provided.

### 2.2. Syntax format
(Contributed by Yu Ming)

The syntax of the commands in this user guide are to be interpreted in the following manner:

Format         | Meaning                | Examples 
-------------- | ---------------------- | ----
`lower_case/`  | Prefix             | `n/`, `p/`, `t/`
`UPPER_CASE`   | Parameter          | `NAME`, `THRESHOLD`, `PRICE`
`[UPPER_CASE]` | Optional Parameter | `[p/THRESHOLD]`

> ⚠️ There **cannot be any spaces** within a prefix. For example, `n /` is an invalid prefix.
>
> ⚠️ If a parameter **does not have any prefixes**, it **must** be the **first parameter**.
> For example, `edit 1 n/NUS Computing Club p/1000` is a valid command but `edit n/NUS Computing Club p/1000 1` is an invalid command.
>
> ⚠️ If an invalid prefix is entered, it will be treated as content for the previous parameter.
>
> ⚠️ If the command does not support multiple inputs of the same prefix, the last occurence will be used.
> For example, `create n/Basketball n/Football` will create a budget named "Fooball".
>
> 📕 Parameters with prefixes can be entered in **any order**.
> For example, `create n/Temasek Hall Student Council p/1200` is equivalent to `create p/1200 n/Temasek Hall Student Council`.

## 3. GUI Layout
(Contributed by Wen Hao)

In this section, you will be given an introduction to the layout of NUSave's Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This will help you better understand what each component that you observe on-screen represents.

There are a total of two pages that you can navigate to when using NUSave:
- Main page
- Budget page

### 3.1. Main Page View

2. Download the latest `NUSave.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for NUSave.

4. Double-click the file to start the application. A GUI similar to [Figure 3.1.1](#31-main-page-view) should appear in a few seconds.
> 📕 If the application does not start after double-clicking the file, you can troubleshoot by doing the following:
>
> <ins>For Windows <a href="#7-glossary">OS</a> users:</ins>
> 1. Launch [command prompt](#7-glossary) and navigate to the path of the home folder for NUSave.
> 2. Enter the following command: `java -jar nusave.jar` as seen in Figure 4.1 below:

(Contributed by Chin Hui)

Format: `find KEYWORD`

Prefix | Parameters | Requirement | Comments | Constraints |
-------| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
\-     | `KEYWORD`     | Required    | Keyword / Keyphrase to be searched | \- |

You can use this command to find expenditures in the current budget whose names contain the given `KEYWORD`. 

When you find expenditures, the list view will filter to only display expenditures whose names contain the given `KEYWORD`.

 > 📕 This command will only find entries that contain the entire `KEYWORD`. For example, `find Blue Shirt` will only find the expenditure named "Sky Blue Shirt" but not "Blue Floral Shirt".

✏️ Example: `find sock`

This will find all expenditures with the keyword "sock" in their names as seen in Figure 5.3.4.1 below:
