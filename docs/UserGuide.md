Thank you for choosing **Common Cents**! This is your convenient at-hand **expense-tracking tool**, meant for **anyone who runs a small-scale business**. 
With just a few commands, _Common Cents_ will keep track, categorise and calculate your income and expenditure for you! 
You can even keep your expenses in multiple accounts for seamless organisation. Amalgamating the features of a 
Command Line Interface (CLI) with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), _Common Cents_ is meant to be functional, intuitive and

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

This User Guide will show you how to navigate the User Interface (UI), give you step-by-step instructions on using commands, tips and tricks on how to maximise your experience with _Common Cents_ and clarify most doubts that you may have.

The _Common Cents_ interface and commands consist of a few levels: `App` level, `Account` level and `Entry` level.<br>
* `App` level commands deal with interactions with the app itself.<br>
* `Account` level commands deal with managing the different accounts in the app.<br>
* `Entry` level commands deal with managing the entries which are either expenses or revenues in an account.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Components
*(Written by Nicholas Canete)* <br>

This section describes the various components that comprises _Common Cents_, mainly Account and Entries. If you
are new to _Common Cents_, do not fret as this section will guide you step by step in understanding the components
available! This will better your experience with _Common Cents_ and your usage of features!

## 4.1 Accounts
*(Written by Nicholas Canete)* <br>

Accounts in _Common Cents_ are key features that help you better manage, categorise, and organise your finances better. 
In _Common Cents_, each account has a unique name, and a unique list of expenses and revenues. 
You can make as many accounts as you'd like in order to help you better categorise and organise your finances better!<br>
 
When you first launch _Common Cents_, a **General Account** is made for you by default, which you may use on top of other
accounts. You may also make new accounts and switch between them and give them their very own set of expenses and revenues.

### 4.1.1 Name
As mentioned in the previous section, you are able to make new accounts on top of the General Account. Every account 
**MUST** have a unique name and duplicate names are not supported, so that you are able to distinguish and identify your
accounts better.

### 4.1.2 Expense List
Each account will have an Expense list - that is, a list of transactions that involve expenditure on your end (i.e.
net outflow of money). In general, expenses keyed into _Common Cents_ have a compulsory Description and Amount, as well as 
optional Tags. In the app user interface, each expense amount will be displayed as a negative value and all the expenses
will be displayed as a scrollable list.

### 4.1.3 Revenue List
Each account will also have a Revenue list - that is, a list of transactions that involve profit from your end (i.e.
net inflow. of money). Like expenses, revenues keyed into _Common Cents_ have a compulsory Description and Amount, as well as 
optional Tags. In the app user interface, each revenue amount will be displayed as a positive value and all the revenues
will be displayed as a scrollable list, right beside the expenses list.

## 4.2 Entries
*(Written by Nicholas Canete)* <br>

'Entry' (or 'Entries') is the term used to describe either Expense or Revenue. Each entry input into _Common Cents_ would 
have compulsory fields - Description, Amount - and optional Tags. 

### 4.2.1 Category
Category is the field that specifies the type of Entry input that _Common Cents_ receives from you. It is used in commands
to differentiate entries between Expense and Revenue. You can either specify the category as an `expense` or a `revenue`,
or `e` or `r` for short and these are not case-sensitive. This documentation uses `expense` or `revenue` as examples in 
the [Features](#5-features) below.

### 4.2.2 Description
Description refers to the textual information that is associated with the Entry that _Common Cents_ receives from you, in
order to provide more information about the Entry.  

### 4.2.3 Amount 
Amount is the numeric value associated with the Entry that _Common Cents_ receives from you. All amounts, for both expenses
and revenues must be given as a positive value.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2.4 Tags
Tags refer to short textual prompts attached to an Entry, with the purpose of giving extra information and identity for
your Entries in _Common Cents_.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Features
*(Written by Jordan Yoong)* <br>

Here are some general notes about the commands in _Common Cents_. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **About the command format:**<br>

* Words in UPPERCASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add c/CATEGORY...`, `CATEGORY` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/REVENUE...`

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `...a/AMOUNT [t/TAG]` can be used as `...a/50.10 t/Supplies` or as `...a/50.10`.

* Parameters **preceded by a prefix** can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `c/CATEGORY d/DESCRIPTION...`, `d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY...` is also acceptable.

* **Numeric** parameters (e.g. `INDEX`) must be in the correct order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `INDEX c/CATEGORY`, only `INDEX c/CATEGORY` is acceptable 
  and `c/CATEGORY INDEX` is invalid. 
  
* Commands with no prefix parameters (e.g. `clear`, `profit`, `listacc`) can take in extra words after the command word
  without affecting its execution.<br>
  e.g. the command `profit abc` works the same as `profit` and is considered valid.

</div>

The commands are separated into three categories: App-Level commands, Entry-Level commands and Account-Level Commands.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**

* When you use the 'edit' command after the 'find' command, if the edited description does not match the predicate, it disappears from the list!

</div>


### 5.2.4 Locating entries by description: `find`
*(Written by Le Hue Man)*

You can use this command to list expenses and/or revenues that have the given keyword(s) in their descriptions. This is 
useful when you want to find some particular entries to [`delete`](#522-deleting-an-entry-delete) or [`edit`](#523-editing-an-entry-edit). 
If there is no expense or revenue found, the respective list will be empty.

**Format:** `find [c/CATEGORY] k/KEYWORDS`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `grocery` will match `grocery` and `Grocery`.
* Only the entry's description is searched.
* The search does not match partial words. e.g. `food` will match `food` and `fast food` but not `fastfood`.
* Entries matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `Food` will return `Hawker food`, 
`Restaurant Food`.
* The `c/CATEGORY` is optional.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

[comment]: <> (This only appears in Github CSS)

:bulb: **Tip:** When there are a lot of entries, and you want to delete something, 
you can use `find` to search for it in the list and use [`delete INDEX`](#522-deleting-an-entry-delete) to remove it from the updated
list, with the updated `INDEX`.

</div>

### 5.2.5 Listing all entries: `list`
*(Written by Jordan Yoong)* <br>

:information_source: **Note:**

* The `clear` command will clear all entries in the stipulated category. If you would like to delete selected
entries, use the `delete` command instead.
* It is possible for you to use the `find` function then `clear`.

</div>

### 5.2.7 Calculating net profits based on expenses and revenues: `profit` 
_(Written by Cheok Su Anne)_

If you wish to calculate the profits you have currently, you may use this command to do so.
 
**Format:** `profit`
 
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**

**Format:** `undo`
 
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:green_book: **Example:**

* `undo`: Returns the state of expenses and revenues prior to the previous command. For example, if the 
[`delete`](#522-deleting-an-entry-delete) command was used (**Figure 5.2-8**), using `undo` returns account to the state before the 
[`delete`](#522-deleting-an-entry-delete) command was used (**Figure 5.2-9**).

</div>

![deleteCommand](images/commands/deleteCommand.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 5.2-8</b>: Before the undo command, an expense was deleted </sub> </p>

![undoCommand](images/commands/undoCommand.png)
<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 5.2-9</b>: After the undo command, the deleted expense is added again </sub> </p>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

* Do note that the `undo` command can only undo  [`add`](#521-adding-an-entry-add), [`delete`](#522-deleting-an-entry-delete),
[`edit`](#523-editing-an-entry-edit) and [`clear`](#526-clearing-all-expenses-or-revenue-clear) commands at the entry-level. 
Account-level commands cannot be reverted using the `undo` command. 
* Once you use the [`switchacc`](#535-switching-accounts-switchacc) command, all the previous states for the `undo` command will be lost. This would mean that if you choose to switch back to the account, you cannot undo the previous entry-level commands anymore.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**

* There is no `redo` command to revert your `undo` command. Do use the `undo` command with caution!
* Once you exit the app, all the previous states will be lost. Do confirm your changes to the entries in the account 
before you exit the app!

</div>

## 5.3 Account-level Commands
Account-Level commands involve managing the different accounts in the app. 

### 5.3.1 Adding new account: `newacc`

or if the account is your only account left.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

If you are unsure of the account index, use [`listacc`](#534-listing-accounts-you-have-listacc) to check the index!
</div>


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**

Deleting your account means all the data of the entries in the account is lost as well. Also, deleting is an 
irreversible action and cannot be undone. Do delete your account with caution!

**Answer:** Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the default data file (in the `data` folder) with the file 
`(CommonCents.json)` that contains the data of your previous _Common Cents_ session.

3\. **Question:** What if I notice something wrong with the application?<br>

**Answer:** You may submit a bug report or send us a notice directly [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp).



## 6.2 Features Inquiry
This section features feature-related questions about _Common Cents_.

1\. **Question:** What happens if I forget my account names?<br>

**Answer:** You may use the `listacc` command to see a full list of your existing accounts.

2\. **Question:** I encountered this situation when using the features as shown in the screenshot below. I understand that the 
prefix indicated is wrong after checking the `add` section in the User Guide. However, the error message states that my category is
wrong (**Figure 6.2**). Can I clarify on this situation?<br>

<p align="center"> <sub> <b>Figure 6.2</b>: Error message that might cause confusion </sub> </p>

**Answer:** 
Yes, the prefix indicated is wrong as it should be `d/` instead of `n/`. As a result, the category parameter is read as
`expense n/buy McSpicy a/8.60` instead of `expense`. Do remember to check that the **prefixes and parameters required for a command
are correct!** If you are unsure of the prefixes and parameters required, do check the sections under features above! 

3\. **Question:** What if I typed in multiple prefixes with valid parameters? For instance, `add c/expense c/revenue d/Buy lunch a/4.30`.

**Answer:** Multiple instances of prefixes, as well as indexes except for `tags (t/)` will not be executed and an error 
message will be shown. For instance, the example above has both `c/expense` and `c/revenue`, hence the command will not be executed. 
Please follow the format of the commands closely in the [Features](#5-features) section above!
