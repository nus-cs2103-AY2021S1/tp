TAskmaster is a **desktop app for managing students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a CS Teaching Assistant who can type fast, TAskmaster can help you track your students' attendance and class participation faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed.
2. Download the jar file from the project website.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
4. Start the app, by doing one of the following:  
    1. Double-click on the file.
    2. Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder in which the jar file is at, and run the command `java -jar taskmaster.jar` (assuming that the file is called `taskmaster.jar`). 
5. A GUI should appear, with the field bar to input commands. The list of commands is available below.

### Usage
1. Add the students that you are currently teaching into TAskmaster using the `add-student` command.
    * You can use the `list-students`, `edit-student`, `find-students` and `delete-student` commands to read, filter and modify your student list.
2. Create a new session that represents a tutorial, lab or recitation session using the `add-session` command.
    * Use `goto` and `delete-session` to switch between and delete sessions.
3. Mark your students' attendance and award them class participation marks with the `mark` and `score` commands respectively.
    * Note that you will not be allowed to use these commands outside of a session.
4. Find present students to call on with the `lowest-score` or `random-student` commands.
    * Note that you will not be allowed to use these commands outside of a session.
5. Clear all data with the `clear` command.
    * This deletes both session and student data.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Set-up
On the first use of TAskmaster, the program will be loaded with a sample student list.
![walkthrough1](images/walkthrough/1.png)

Enter the `clear` command to delete all existing data in TAskmaster.
![walkthrough2](images/walkthrough/2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 2: Add Students
Then, add the students that you are currently teaching into the student list using the `add-student` command.
![walkthrough3](images/walkthrough/3.png)

* Note that a student must have a non-empty name, a valid telegram handle, email address and NUSNET id.
* No two students in the student list can share the same NUSNET id.
* You can use the `find-students`, `edit-student` and `delete-student` commands to filter and modify your student list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 3: Add a Session
After adding all your students, you can create a new session that represents a tutorial, lab or recitation session using
the `add-session` command. TAskmaster will automatically switch to the new session view.
![walkthrough4](images/walkthrough/4.png)

* TAskmaster will read the current student list and create a list of corresponding student records that belongs to the new session created.
* Each student in the student list is by a student record
* This list of records, once created, will be **independent of the student list**. Any modifications to the student list after a session is created **will not** affect the student records in that session.
* You can use the `delete-session` command to delete a session from the session list. This will delete all data (including student records) stored in that session.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 4: Session View
Within the session view, you can see a list of records representing the students that are enrolled in that session.
![walkthrough10](images/walkthrough/10.png)

Legend:
1. Session name
2. Session date and time
3. Name of student
4. NUSNET ID of student
5. Attendance
6. Class participation score  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 5: Mark Attendance
Mark your students' attendance with the `mark` commands.
![walkthrough5](images/walkthrough/5.png)
![walkthrough6](images/walkthrough/6.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 6: Get Present Students
TAskmaster provides you with two ways to get students to call on to answer questions.
* The `lowest-score` command shows a student that is present and currently has the lowest score. If there are multiple
present students with the lowest score, the command will show all of them.
![walkthrough7](images/walkthrough/7.png)
* The `random-student` command chooses a student that is present randomly.
![walkthrough8](images/walkthrough/8.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 7: Award Class Participation
You can award class participation score to students using the `score` command.
![walkthrough9](images/walkthrough/9.png)

### Step 8: Switch Views
Note that you will not be allowed to use any session view commands outside of a session.
* To switch to a session view, use the `goto` command or click the corresponding button on the left, under 'Sessions'. 
* To go back to the student list view, use the `list-students` command or click the Student List button on the left.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Step 9: Exit TAskmaster
When you are done with TAskmaster, use the `exit` command to close the application.
 * Data will be saved automatically.

```
mark INDEX a/ATTENDANCE_TYPE
```
- This command can only be used when a session is selected.
- Marks the attendance at the specified `INDEX` number shown in the displayed student record list.

TAskmaster supports a detailed score of up to 2 decimal places.
For scores with more than 2 decimal places, the score will be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.  
TAskmaster supports scoring students' participation score even though the student is absent, to allow for
module-specific instructions (e.g. a module coordinator instructs the TA to give
a participation mark of 6 if a valid MC is given).

To score all students **who are present**, you can replace the `INDEX` with the keyword `all`.

Example Usage:

score 1 cp/5
score 3 cp/6.9
score 4 cp/4.21
score all cp/10
score all cp/2.94

```
random-student
```
- This command can only be used when a session is selected.

## Storage
The TAskmaster stores the running list of students and sessions automatically to JSON files when they are updated.
This means that your data is saved even if the app is not shutdown with the `exit` command.

**Student data** is stored in `data/taskmaster.json`
**Session data** is stored in `data/session_list.json`

Avoid modifying the files as this may cause the program to read the input as invalid on startup and load with an
empty student list without any sessions.
