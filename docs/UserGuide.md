# Tutor's Pet - User Guide

1. Table of Contents
{:toc}

## Introduction

Tutor's Pet is a **student management application** for teaching assistants in NUS Computing.
Tutor's Pet reduces the amount of time you spend on administrative tasks as a teaching assistant.
It is a one stop solution to keep track of your classes and students.

As a teaching assistant, administrative chores such as attendance taking and grading students' participation
can be troublesome with existing solutions such as spreadsheets. This is why we have created Tutor's Pet, _a
solution for teaching assistants, by students._
