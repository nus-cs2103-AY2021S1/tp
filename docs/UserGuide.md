## 3. Features

This section serves to provide you a detailed explanation of how the various features of **Reeve** work and how to use these features.

### 3.1 Understanding the command format

The following points explain how to make sense of the command format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [a/DETAIL_TEXT]` can be used as `n/John Doe a/Likes to read books` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[a/DETAIL_TEXT]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `a/Likes to read books`, `a/Likes sweets a/Needs help with Algebra` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

### 3.2 General features

This section serves to provide you a detailed explanation of the general features which will help you to maximise the potential of **Reeve**.

#### 3.2.2 Toggling between academic and administrative details: `toggle` (By: Hogan)

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
