### Commands  <a name="commands"></a>
1. **Add an Expense `add`** <a name="add"></a>
    - Order of arguments is flexible.
    - If multiple fields of the same type are specified, only the last one is processed.
    - Date input (dd-MM-yyyy) is optional, defaults to system's date (usually today).
    - Tag (or category) input is optional, defaults to the "Default" category. This means that the expense is subtracted from the "Default" Budget.
    - Format: `add -d <description> -$<amount_spent> [-@<date>] [t/<category>]`
    - Example: `add -d dinner -$10.50` Adds the expense to **current date's** record.
    - Example: `add -d dinner -$10.50 -@24-06-2020 t/Food` Adds the expense under **24 June 2020** and tags it under "Food" category.

    _**Specifying Category/Tag**_
    - Example: `add -d dinner -$10.50 -@20-08-2020 t/Food t/Basic` As stated above, only `t/Basic` is processed, thus the expense is tagged with the "Basic" category, if it exists.
    - Input constraints:
      - If specified, the tag input must match one of the existing categories in the expense book. If not, the
       expense will be added to the "Default" category - the new category needs to be created first (see [addCategory](#addCat))
      - The expense to be added must not share the same identity fields (description, amount and date) as any expense in the expense book.
