## 1. Introduction

CliniCal(Clinic Calendar) is a **desktop app that allows doctors to manage patient records and schedule upcoming appointments**. With CliniCal, you can enhance your daily workflow through the effective scheduling of medical appointments. You can also have access to a digital database that safely stores all your patient records. 

Furthermore, CliniCal is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) and even retains the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CliniCal can get your work done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/ALLERGY]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/penicillin` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[g/ALLERGY]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `g/penicillin`, `g/sulfa g/aspirin` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
