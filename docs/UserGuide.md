## User Interface Overview

Momentum uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to get input from you, and display information to you. Different parts of this GUI perform different functions, as explained below:

![OverviewUI](images/OverviewUI2.png)

1. **Command Box**: The place where you enter in your commands.
2. **Results Box**: Displays the result of executing the commands that you enter.
3. **Display List**: Displays a list of projects or tasks.
4. **Reminders Panel**: This is where reminders will appear. The panel will only be present when there are reminders that have not yet been dismissed.
5. **Active Timers Panel**: Displays all the timers that are currently running.
(see [Active Timers Panel](#active-timers-panel))
6. **Statistics Panel**: Displays the statistics data calculated by Momentum.
(see [Statistics](#statistics))
7. **Tags Panel**: Displays a collection of all the tags visible in the display list.
8. **Bottom Bar**: Displays contextual information about what you are viewing, such as the specific project that you are viewing, and the number of items in the display list hidden due to finding or sorting commands.

The active timers, statistics, tags and reminders panels can be resized to display more information by clicking and draging their edges.

### User Interface Theme

The GUI Momentum also comes with two themes, light and dark. These themes are shown below:
![GUI Themes](images/GUIThemeDiagram.png)
You can adjust the themes to your preference, by changing it in the application settings. (see [Settings](#settings))

## Command Format

Below is an explanation of the formatting used to show commands:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Blog Design`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Blog Design t/friend` or as `n/Blog Design`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Items with `…` inside square brackets `[t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...]` can take in multiple space separated arguments
  e.g. `[[t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...]` can represent `t/friend friend family`.
* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. If the command specifies `n/Blog Design dd/2020-11-05`, `dd/2020-11-05 n/Blog Design` is also acceptable.

#### View All Projects : `list`

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

When viewing projects, this command shows a list of all projects in Momentum.

When viewing a project's tasks, this command shows a list of all the tasks for the project.

Note that this command is different from the `home` command. When viewing a project's tasks, the `home` command will change the view to show all the projects being tracked by Momentum. However, the `list` will only show all the tasks for the project.

Format: `list`

#### Sort Projects : `sort`

Done by Kang Su Min

Sorts the list of displayed projects or tasks in the application.

Format: `sort [type/SORT_TYPE] [order/SORT_ORDER] [c/]`

* There are 3 types of sort.
  * `type/alpha` will sort the list of projects in alphabetical order.
  * `type/deadline` will sort the list of projects according to their deadlines.
  * `type/created` will sort the list of projects according to their date of creation.

* There are 2 sort orders.
  * `order/asc` will sort the list of projects in ascending order.
  * `order/dsc` will sort the list of projects in descending order.

* The projects can be sorted by completion status.
    * This is the default sort, and is also the "dominant sort" that will ensure that all incomplete projects/tasks will be ordered before complete projects/tasks when completion status order is on.
    Within incomplete and complete projects/tasks, they will be ordered by specified order (alphabetical/deadline/created date, ascending/descending).
    * Run `sort c/` to toggle the default completion status sort.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

* `type/alpha` and `order/asc` will be used as default if both sort type and order are not specified (i.e. command is `sort`)
* Current sort type will be used if the `type` is not specified but `order` is specified.
* `order/asc` will be used as default if the `order` is not specified but `type` is specified.
* For `sort type/deadline`, projects without deadlines will be ordered alphabetically after the ordered list of projects with deadlines.
* For both `sort type/deadline` and `sort type/created`, projects with same deadline or same created date will be sorted alphabetically.

</div>

**Sorting by Default Order**

Format: `sort`

* Sorts projects in alphabetical, ascending order

The following walkthrough shows how a user can sort projects in Momentum by the default order

1. Key in command `sort` in the command window.
![Default Sort Step 1](images/DefaultSort1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Default Sort Step 2](images/DefaultSort2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in default ascending alphabetical order with incomplete tasks showing up at the top of the list.
![Default Sort Step 3](images/DefaultSort3.png)

##### Sorting With Completion Status Toggle

* Toggles the completion status order i.e. if the completion status order is "on" with incomplete projects/tasks showing up at the top of the list, the completion status order is turned "off", which sorts the projects/tasks in the specified order without regard for its completion status.

Format: `sort c/`

This toggles the completion status order and then sorts projects in default alphabetical, ascending order.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can sort projects in Momentum by toggling the completion status order.

1. Key in command `sort c/` in the command window.
![Toggle Completion Status Step 1](images/ToggleCompletionStatus1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Toggle Completion Status Step 2](images/ToggleCompletionStatus2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in default ascending alphabetical order without regard for completion status.
![Toggle Completion Status Step 3](images/ToggleCompletionStatus3.png)

##### Sorting with Only Type Specified

Format: `sort type/SORT_TYPE`

* Sorts projects in a specified order
* Since order is not specified, default order is ascending

Example: `sort type/deadline`

The following walkthrough shows how a user can sort projects in Momentum by specifying only the sort type.

1. Key in command `sort type/deadline` in the command window.
![Deadline Sort 1](images/DeadlineSort1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Deadline Sort 2](images/DeadlineSort2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in ascending deadline order.
![Deadline Sort 3](images/DeadlineSort3.png)

##### Sorting With Only Order Specified

Format: `sort order/SORT_ORDER`

* Sorts projects in specified sort order, according to current sort type.
* If there is no existing project order (when the application restarts), order will be alphabetical by default.

Example: `sort order/dsc`

The following walkthrough shows how a user can sort projects in Momentum by specifying only the sort order.

1. Key in command `sort order/dsc` in the command window.
![Deadline Sort Descending 1](images/DeadlineDescending1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Deadline Sort Descending 2](images/DeadlineDescending2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in descending deadline order (Projects were ordered by deadline previously).
![Deadline Sort Descending 3](images/DeadlineDescending3.png)

##### Sorting With Both Type and Order Specified

* Sorts projects in specified type and order.

Example: `sort type/created order/dsc`

The following walkthrough shows how a user can sort projects in Momentum by specifying both sort type and order.

1. Key in command `sort type/created order/dsc` in the command window.
![Created Descending 1](images/CreatedDescending1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Created Descending 2](images/CreatedDescending2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in descending created date order.
![Created Descending 3](images/CreatedDescending3.png)

#### Filtering Projects: `find`

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

Searches for projects or tasks in the project book based on certain parameters.

Format: `find [match/FILTER_TYPE] [n/NAME [MORE_NAMES]...] [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...] [c/COMPLETION_STATUS]`

* There are three values for the `match` parameter.
    * `match/all` shows an entry only if **all** of the parameters provided in the user's input matches the entry.
    * `match/any` shows an entry as long as **any** of the parameters provided in the user's input matches the entry.
    * `match/none` shows an entry only if **none** of the parameters provided in the user's input matches the entry.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
You can only search for projects in the project view and tasks in the tasks view

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
`match/any` will be used if the `match` type is not specified.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
Search parameters are not case sensitive.

</div>

##### Searching by Name

* The `n/` command checks whether a project has a certain name. There can be multiple names added to this command. For example, `n/car window` will check for the projects that contain `car` or `window` in their names.
* Searching by name only requires a partial match. This means that a project with the name `carpet` and `car` can potentially be the result of searching for the term `car`.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can use the find command to search for projects with the `ad` in their names.

1. Key in the command `find n/ad` in the command window.
![Find by Name Step 1](images/FindByName1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Name Step 2](images/FindByName2.png)
3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name will be shown.
![Find by Name Step 3](images/FindByName3.png)

##### Searching by Description

* The `d/` command checks whether a project has a certain description. There can be multiple descriptions added to this command. For example, `d/sunday october` will check for the projects that contain `sunday` or `october` in their description.
* Searching by description only requires a partial match, similar to searching by name.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can use the find command to search for projects with the `discussion` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find d/discussion` in the command window.
![Find by Description Step 1](images/FindByDescription1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Description Step 2](images/FindByDescription2.png)
3. All projects that contain `discussion` in their description will be shown.
![Find by Description Step 3](images/FindByDescription3.png)

##### Searching by Tag

* The `t/` command checks whether a project has a certain tag. There can be multiple tags added to this command. For example, `t/freelance errands` will check for the projects that contain the tags `freelance` or `errands`.
* Searching by tags will require a full word match unlike searching by name or description. This means that searching for the tag `free` will not find a project with the tag `freelance`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
Searches for tags require a full match whilst partial matches are sufficient for searches by name and description.

</div>

The following walkthrough shows how a user can use the find command to search for projects with the tag `webdesign`.

1. Key in the command `find t/webdesign` in the command window.
![Find by Tag Step 1](images/FindByTag1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Tag Step 2](images/FindByTag2.png)
3. All projects that contain the tag `webdesign` will be shown.
![Find by Tag Step 3](images/FindByTag3.png)

##### Searching by Completion Status

* There are keywords, completed and incomplete for`c/KEYWORD`. Other keywords are not accepted.
* The `c/` command checks whether a project is completed. For example, `c/completed` will check for the projects that are completed.
* When `c/` is not specified, both complete and incomplete projects will be shown.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can use the find command to search for projects that have been completed.

1. Key in the command `find c/completed` in the command window.
![Find by Completion Step 1](images/FindByCompletion1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Completion Step 2](images/FindByCompletion2.png)
3. All projects that are completed will be shown.
![Find by Completion Step 3](images/FindByCompletion3.png)

##### Searching with Multiple Parameters

You can search for projects/tasks with multiple keywords for names, descriptions and tags in a single search.

A match type can also be specified as mentioned at the [start of this section](#filtering-projects-find).

Please look at the examples below to get a better understanding of how you can make searches with multiple parameters.

Examples:

Let's say that you have the following projects in Momentum:

1. Name: `Create Logo` , Description: `Make logo for startup XYZ`, Tags: `Design`
2. Name: `Write Song`, Description: `80s rock music, three minutes`, Tags: `Music`
3. Name: `Write Article`, Description: `Write an article about why Momentum is the best app out there`, Tags: `Press` and `Writing`

* `find match/any n/song article d/startup t/design` will return all three projects. This is because project 1 contains the keyword `startup` in its description and the tag `design`, project 2 contains the keyword `song` in its name and project 3 contains the keyword `article` in its name.

* `find match/all n/song article d/startup t/design` will not return any project as there is no project with `song` **and** `article` in its name **and** `startup` in its description and the tag `design`.

* `find match/none n/song article d/startup t/design` will not return any project as there is no project that **does not** contain `song` and `article` in its name, `startup` in its description and the tag `design`.

* `find match/any n/write d/rock` will return projects 2 and 3. This is because project 2 contains `write` in its name and `rock` in its description. Project 3 also contains the word `write` in its name.

* `find match/all n/write d/rock` will only return project 2. This is because project 2 is the only project that contains both `write` in its name **and** `rock` in its description.

* `find match/none n/write d/rock` will return project 1. This is because only project 1 **does not** contain
 `write` in its name and `rock` in its descriptions.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
If a certain search type is used more than once, the latest entry will be used.
`find n/a n/b n/c` will only search for projects/tasks that contain`c` in their name.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
The projects/tasks in Momentum will no longer be filtered after the `Add`, `View` or `Home` Commands are used.
They will continue to be filtered after the `Edit` and `Delete` Commands are used.
</div>

### Time Tracking

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

You can track the time you spend working on a project or task by starting a timer when you start working, and then
 stopping the timer once you finish.

Momentum remembers each timer that you start/stop and uses this information to calculate statistics.

#### Starting a Timer for a Project: `start`

Format: `start ID`

* Starts a timer for the project or task at the specified `ID`.
* Only 1 timer can be running for each project or task at any time.
* The id refers to the id number shown in the displayed list.
* The id **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
You can run timers for more than one project or task concurrently, if you are multi-tasking.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
You can run timers for a project separately from its tasks. This allows you to track the time you spent on the
 project as a whole, as well as the time spent on each individual task.

</div>

Example: `start 2`

Result: Starts a timer for the second project or task in the display list.

#### Stopping a Timer for a Project: `stop`

Format: `stop ID`

* Stops a running timer for the project or task at the specified `ID`.
* A timer can only be stopped if there is one already running.
* The id refers to the id number shown in the displayed list.
* The id **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Example: `stop 2`

Result: Stops the timer for the second project or task in the display list.

#### Active Timers Panel

On the left side of the window is the Active Timers Panel. This is where Momentum shows you all the timers that are
 currently running.

![ActiveTimersUI](images/ActiveTimersUI.png)

This panel will show you the name of the project/task, as well as when the timer was started.

#### Time Tracking Example

Here is an example of how you can use the `start` and `stop` commands to track the time that you spend on a project.
Suppose that you are going to start working on the project "Alpharad Youtube Endcard", which is the first item shown
 below:

![TimerExample1](images/TimerExample1.png)

You can perform time tracking with the following steps:

1. To start the timer, type `start 1` into the command box and press `Enter`.

    ![TimerExample2](images/TimerExample2.png)

2. You should see the following message in the result box, indicating that the timer has been successfully started.

    ![TimerExample3](images/TimerExample3.png)

3. You should also see the project's name and start time in the active timers panel:

    ![TimerExample4](images/TimerExample4.png)

4. Now that the timer has been successfully started, you can proceed to do your work. You can also choose to close
 Momentum. The timer will continue to run even when Momentum is closed. Proceed to the next step when you are done
  with your work.

5. To stop the timer, type `stop 1` into the command box and press `Enter`.

    ![TimerExample5](images/TimerExample5.png)

6. You should see the following message in the result box, indicating that the timer has been successfully stopped.

    ![TimerExample6](images/TimerExample6.png)

7. You should also see that the project has been removed from the active timers panel:

    ![TimerExample7](images/TimerExample7.png)

8. The statistics panel (see [statistics](#statistics)) will also be updated to reflect the time that you have spent
 working on the
 project:

    ![TimerExample8](images/TimerExample8.png)

### Undo/Redo

Done By Kang Su Min

Undo command undoes previous command and redo command redoes previously undone command.

#### Undoing the Previous Command: `undo`

The undo command resets the application to the state before previous command was executed.

Format: `undo`

Example: `start 1`, `undo`

Result: Timer for project/task at index 1 is started, then stopped and removed after undo is executed.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can start a timer for a project, then undo the command.

1. Key in command `start 1` in the command window.
![Undo 1](images/Undo1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully, and the timer for that project will appear at the side panel.
![Undo 2](images/Undo2.png)
3. Key in command `undo` in the command window.
![Undo 3](images/Undo3.png)
4. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been undone successfully.
![Undo 4](images/Undo4.png)
5. The timer has been removed from the project. Timer is no longer running.
![Undo 5](images/Undo5.png)

#### Redoing the Previous Command: `redo`

The redo command redoes previously undone command and resets the application to the state before the previous undo command.

Format: `redo`

Example: `sort type/deadline`, `undo`, `redo`

Result: Projects are sorted by deadline, then the application is reset to the sorting order before sort command was executed, then reset back to sort by deadline after redo command.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can start a timer for a project, then undo the command.

1. Key in command `sort type/deadline` in the command window.
![Redo 1](images/Redo1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully. Projects have been sorted in ascending deadline order (Completion Status: On).
![Redo 2](images/Redo2.png)
3. Key in command `undo` in the command window.
![Redo 3](images/Redo3.png)
4. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been undone successfully. Projects have been reverted to their original order before the last sort command was executed.
![Redo 4](images/Redo4.png)
5. Key in command `redo` in the command window.
![Redo 5](images/Redo5.png)
6. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been redone successfully.
![Redo 6](images/Redo6.png)
7. Projects are again sorted in ascending deadline order (Completion Status: On).
![Redo 7](images/Redo7.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

* Undo/redo feature keeps track of changes in state, and hence will not work on `help` command which does not change the state of the application.
* Redo command only works if the previous command is `undo`.

</div>

### Statistics

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

Momentum uses the data collected from your timers (see [time tracking](#time-tracking)) to calculate statistics. These
 statistics are automatically generated and updated whenever you make any changes to your projects and tasks, such as
  when timers for a project/task are started or stopped.
 These statistics can be seen in a panel on the left side of the window, as shown here:

![StatisticsUI1](images/StatsUI1.png)

The statistics displayed correspond to the projects or tasks currently shown in the list, and will automatically
 change when the items in the list changes (such as when you find specific projects or sort the list of projects).

![StatisticsUI2](images/StatsUI2.png)

You do not need to use any additional commands to update or view the statistics.

#### Timeframes

Momentum only tracks your statistics within a particular timeframe. By default, the timeframe will be set to weekly.
You can change the timeframe through the [settings](#settings).

Momentum allows you to track the time spent within these timeframes:

* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly

Here are the statistics being tracked by Momentum:

#### Time Spent Per Project

This statistic tells you the total amount of time you have spent within the timeframe. For projects, this includes
 all the time you have spent on each individual task, as well as on the project as a whole.

![StatsUISplit](images/StatsUISplit.png)

The statistics are displayed in 2 different formats:

1. **Pie Chart**: Shows the relative time spent on each project. Useful for comparing different projects and tasks. Projects
 and tasks with less time spent on them may not be shown.
2. **Table**: Shows the exact (in minutes) amount of time spent on each project. Useful for calculations.

### Settings

Done by Khoo De Hui

You can adjust various settings in Momentum, which includes:
* GUI Theme
* Statistics Timeframe

Format: `set [th/THEME] [st/TIMEFRAME]`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* There are two GUI themes available, light and dark. The keywords to apply them are:
  * `th/light`
  * `th/dark`
* There are three available timeframes for statistics, daily, weekly and monthly. The keywords to apply them are:
  * `st/daily`
  * `st/weekly`
  * `st/monthly`

Example: `set th/light st/monthly`

Result: Sets a dark theme to the GUI and changes the statistics pane to show the time spent on projects within the day.
