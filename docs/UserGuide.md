## Introduction

PlaNus is a **desktop application that manages tasks** for students in NUS with **busy schedule**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI). PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is simple and quick!

Objectives of PlaNus:

1. Provide students with a detailed breakdown of how much time they spend on their tasks and lessons in their respective modules.
2. Allow students to have a calendar view of their schedule.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

You can also delete lessons by **first finding the lessons of interest**, refer to [feature 3.4](#34-find-a-lesson--find-lesson)
for more information. Sample usage:

* `find-lesson title:Lab` followed by `delete-lesson 1` 
  * Deletes the 1st lesson in the result lesson list of the `find-lesson` command.

## 4. Calendar View

(Done by: Marcus)

PlaNus has two application views:

* **Task and Lesson view**: interface where you can see the list of your tasks and lessons
* **Calendar view**: interface where you can see all your tasks and lessons in a calendar

You can switch between **Task and Lesson View** and **Calendar View**.

<br>

Switching from **Task and Lesson View** to **Calendar View**:

Format: `calendar`

Example:

1) Type `calendar` into the command box.

 <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

2) The **Calendar View** will appear as shown below.

![calendar view month](images/CalendarViewMonth.png)

<br>

With the **Calendar View**, you can have a clear and intuitive view of:

* how many events ans lessons you have on each day of the current month in the calendar's **Month View**.
* what events and lessons you have for a particular day in the calendar's **Day View**.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes**<br>

* Days in the **Calendar View** that are marked as grey are days that are not in the current month, and therefore unclickable. However, they can still display the number of events and lessons.

</div>

Changing back to **Task and Lesson View**:

You can change back to **Task and Lesson view** (which is displayed when the app starts) by issuing a `list-task` command or a `list-lesson` command.

## 5. Time Analysis

(Done by: Marcus)

You can use the pie chart and list of modules to visualise how much time you spent on each module **in the past week**. PlaNus calculates the time spent on each module based on the module code in its `tag`.

![data analysis](images/DataAnalysis.png)

How does it work:

* Each module has a **time spent on tasks** and **time spent on lessons**.
* When a `deadline` is marked as done, it contributes towards **time spent on tasks** for that module.
* When an `event` has occurred, it contributes towards **time spent on tasks** for that module.
* When a `lesson` has occurred, it contributes towards **time spent on a lesson** for that module.

 <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
 
Example:

![data analysis example](images/DataAnalysisExample.png)

* The first lesson in the list:
  * Title of "CS2105 Lecture"
  * Only occurred once in the past week
  * Last for 2 hours from 14:00 to 16:00

Therefore, the **time analysis for the week** will show that the **time spent on lessons** with the CS2105 `tag` as
120 minutes (2 hours).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes**<br>

* In v1.4 (current version):
  * Only time spent on each module in the **past week** is displayed.

* In the upcoming version:
  * A breakdown of time spent on each module in the **past week** and of **all time** is displayed.

</div>

* Event: Consists of a start time, end time and the date which it occurs on.
* Deadline: Consists of the date and time which the deadline falls on.
* Lesson: Consists of events that repeat every week for specified time period.
