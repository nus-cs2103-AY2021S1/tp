PropertyFree is adapted from AB3. It prefers leveraging on Command 
Line Interface for those who are more comfortable with typing than with Graphical User Interface (GUI).

**PropertyFree is a management system for property agents to track and manage their property listing 
details.** It allows users to easily take control of their bookkeeping matters inclusive of seller ask prices, 
bidder buy prices, key details of properties and record keeping of past properties. 

PropertyFree also provides a 
calendar for property agents to manage their schedule be it for property viewings or meeting with clients. 
It is optimized for CLI users so that the bookkeeping can be done faster by typing in commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the .jar file and run the file by running it via command line or by left clicking if your device is able to.

Note that PropertyFree.jar should be run inside a folder.

- ```Sellers``` are the owners of the properties listed in PropertyFree.
- ```Bidders``` are the interested buyers who place a bid on a property.


**Seller** - A seller is the owner of a property that wants to list their house for sale. It is assigned a unique Seller Id. 

**Bidder** - A bidder is a person who wishes to bid for the purchase of a certain property. It is assigned a unique Bidder Id.

**Property** - A property is a listed estate that is up for bidder to place bids on. A property can only be added
if the given Seller Id exists in the seller list. It is assigned a unique Property Id.

**Bid** - A Bid is an offer attempt by a bidder for a specific property. A bid can only be placed if the given Property Id
and Bidder Id exists in the property list and bidder list.

**Meeting** - A meeting can be of 3 types. 

 1. View - For viewing of properties.
 2. Admin - For general admin meetings.
 3. Paperwork - For signing of paperwork related to the selling and buying of the property.
 
 All types of meeting require a valid Property Id and Bidder Id for it to be added to the schedule.

💡 SELLER_ID indicates the id of the seller.

💡 BIDDER_ID indicates the id of the bidder.

💡 PROPERTY_ID indicates the id of the property listing.

💡 MEETINGDATE indicates the meeting date of the meeting.

💡 STARTTIME indicates the start time of the meeting.

💡 PHONE_NUMBER indicates the mobile phone number of the client.

PropertyFree assumes that **all phone numbers are unique**, and as such will not allow duplicates of
phone number. 

Note that the ```Tag``` and ```Id``` for both ```bidder```
and ```seller``` are created automatically and ***cannot be modified***.
- ```Tag```: Visual identifier for clients
- ```Id```: Unique ID assigned to each client for identification.

💡 Note that the following applies for information of a client.

1. The length of the name of any clients 
that PropertyFree accepts is of **26 characters or lesser** (including spaces).

2. Names are `CASE SENSITITVE` (i.e Dianne and dianne are recognised as two different names).
3. The length of the phone number of any clients that PropertyFree accepts is of **10 numbers or lesser** 
and `+` should not be added.

# Coming Soon

1. Integration of `Meeting` with `CalendarView` where the dates stated in `MeetingBook`,
will be highlighted in `CalenderView`.

2. User would be able to mark if listed property is a closed deal or not.

3. Check for clash of `Meeting` timings across the different timings that are listed.

4. User will not be able to create a `Meeting` with a very long venue length.
