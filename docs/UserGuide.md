## Preface (How should I navigate this entire document?)

### Structure

Our team at Bagel has structured this User Guide to improve your reading experience and aid you in locating the information you are searching for efficiently. 
Below, we will provide a few useful tips on how to optimally read this guide.
We will then proceed to elaborate on the features of Bagels with concrete examples that you can try out to get used to our interface!

### How can you optimally read this guide?

Dread that you'll not be familiar with command-line interfaces or conventional technical terms? Afraid to feel lost amongst complicated technical jargon?
Here, we will guide you with through technical terms, symbols and syntax that are used throughout this guide. You may want to
take a brief look through this section before moving to the next section!

#### Understanding our GUI

The figure below is the GUI of **Bagel** with some annotations that we would like to guide you through:

![AnnotatedUI](images/GUIGuidance.png) <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here is a table to better understand how to put our GUI into best use:

| GUI Feature |  What will it do? / What is this for? |
|----------|-------------|
| User Input Command Box  | This is where you can enter the relevant Bagel commands for it to execute. |
| Command Feedback Box | This box will provide you with feedback accordingly, (i.e. if your command has been executed). It is especially useful if your command fails to execute as it will provide you with the source of error! |
| Buttons for Sets | These buttons will appear and disappear automatically when you add a new set or delete all your flashcards in an existing set. This is a feature for point-and-click navigation, just in case you simply opened Bagel to revise and not make any changes! |
| Flashcard Display List | This list will display your selected list of flashcards (i.e. filtered or not). It will even show you a specific flashcard with all its details when you want it to (i.e. View Command). |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Bagel's Symbols and Syntax

The table below will guide you through the general symbols and specific technical terms used in our guide:

| Syntax |  Bagel's Definition |
|----------|-------------|
| <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: </div>  | An exclamation mark indicates that the following text is a tip. |
| <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger"> :warning: </div> | A warning sign indicates that the following text is important. |
| Command Word/Command | The specific word that is a command in Bagel which will determines an action that Bagel will perform for you. |
| Parameter | The words, phrases or values following each prefix given to a command to execute your specified action.|
| Prefix | The characters after every command word and at the start of a parameter. E.g. "/t" or "/d". |

**Here is an example to help you understand the table better:** <br>
`add t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION s/SET [l/LINK] [tag/TAG]…`

* Command Word/Command: `add` <br>
* Parameters: `TITLE`, `DESCRIPTION`, `SET`, `LINK`, `TAG` <br>
* Prefixes: `t/`, `d/`, `s/`, `l/`, `t/`  <br>


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add t/TITLE`, TITLE is the parameter which can be used.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/p-value tag/Definition` or as `t/p-value`.<br>
  e.g. `[s/1]` is optional.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. in `[tag/TAG]…`, can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/Definition, tag/Formula tag/Important` etc.

* User should supply the index of the flashcard behind commands.<br>
  e.g. `view 1`, `delete 10`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* Although it is not recommended to supply duplicate parameters, they will still be accepted. However,
only the last parameter supplied will be considered.
  e.g. if the command entered is `add t/title 1 t/title 2 d/description`, the title of the flashcard added will be
  `title 2`, as only `t/title 2` will be considered.
</div>

## Features

### Adding a flashcard: `add`

Want to make a new flashcard? This command will add a new flashcard to your current list of flashcards, into the set that you have specified.

* Deletes the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed flashcards list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* If only one flashcard is shown, its `INDEX` is `1`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
**:information_source: Warning:**<br>
Once you delete a flashcard, there is no way to undo this and retrieve it! Make sure that you have a copy of your file somewhere else, or
that you would like to delete this specific flashcard!
</div>

Example:
* `delete 1` will permanently delete/remove your flashcard that is set at index `1`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a flashcard: `edit`

Made a mistake? No worries! This command lets you edit a specific flashcard.

Format: `edit INDEX [t/TITLE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [s/SET] [l/LINK] [tag/TAG]…​`

* Edits the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed flashcard list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* If only one flashcard is shown, its `INDEX` is `1`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. New tags will be added without replacing any of the old tags.
* You can remove all the flashcard’s tags by typing `tag/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Similarly, you can remove the flashcard's link by typing `l/`.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 t/Data analysis` edits the title of the 1st flashcard to be `Data analysis`.
*  `edit 1 t/p-value d/probability of…` edits the title and description of the 1st flashcard to be `p-value` and `probability of…` respectively.

Visual walkthrough:
1. Type `list` into the command box and hit enter to view all flashcards.
   ![edit example](images/editExample1.png)
1. Look for the index of the card you want to edit.<br>
   For example, if you want to edit the flashcard with title `Types of Sampling Plan`, the index here is `2`, written to the left of the title.
1. Type `edit  2` in the command box, followed with the information to be edited.<br>
   For example, if you want to change the title to `Sampling Plan`, write `t/Sampling Plan`.
   ![edit example](images/editExample2.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* To view another flashcard, enter `list` to go back to the entire list of flashcards. Then `view INDEX` of the next flashcard
you would like to view.
</div>

Visual walkthrough: 
1. Use `list` to obtain the index of the flashcard you want to view. In this example, you want to view the flashcard with the
title `Types of Sampling Plan`.
![view example](images/viewExample1.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: Where is the data from Bagel stored?<br>
**A**: By default, a data folder will be created in the same folder as the `bagel.jar` file.
After running the app for the first time, you can change the file path by editing `preferences.json`
in the same folder directly. Since your data is stored locally in your hard disk, you will not have to worry about any data theft.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install Bagel in the other computer and copy-and-paste the data folder into the same folder
as the `bagel.jar` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Glossary

* __Duplicate flashcard__: Two flashcards that have the same title and description are considered duplicate flashcards.
Duplicate flashcards are disallowed, even if they have different links, set numbers, or tags. This is to ensure that users will not make a mistake
while adding flashcards, and to prevent confusion.

* __Mainstream OS__: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

* __Set__: It acts similarly to a folder in the real world. To categorize your flashcards, and maximise your efficiency,
do be sure to make use of the 'set' feature to place flashcards into different sets.
