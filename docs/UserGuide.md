Police Investigation Virtual Organisational Tool (PIVOT) is a **desktop app to assist the police investigators in keeping track of their investigations and relevant information. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, PIVOT can manage your investigation cases faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Set Up

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for PIVOT.

1. Run the command `java -jar pivot.jar` using the Command Line at the _home folder_ to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   
    ![Home Page at Main](images/home_main.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## Navigating PIVOT

1. When you first start the app, you will be at the `Home` section's `Main Page` (You can navigate between the `Home` or `Archive` sections). In the image below, the `navigation bar` is highlighted. It shows where you are in the app at any point in time. The `Command Line` allows you to enter the commands, and the feedback is displayed in the `Result Display`.

    ![Home Page at Main, highlighted navigation](images/home_main_nav.png)

1. The left panel highlighted in the image below is the `Main Page` of the app. It lists all of the `Cases` stored in PIVOT according to the `Section` you are in. By using a `Main Page Command`,  you can interact with the `Cases` in this page. (Refer to [Main page](#main-page) below for the commands)

1. By typing `open case 1` in the Command Line, the right panel is updated. This is `Case Page` of the app (highlighted below). It displays the `Case` information. By using a `Case Page Command`,  you can interact with the `Case` details in this page. (Refer to [Investigation Case page](#investigation-case-page) below for the commands)

    ![Home Page at Case, highlighted main and case page](images/home_case_nav.png)
    
1. By typing `return`, the right panel is closed and the app returns to the `Main Page`. Notice the changes in the `navigation bar`.

1. By typing `list archive`, the page changes colour. You are now at the `Archive` section. The layout is the same as the `Home` section, as well as the commands that can be used.

    ![Archive Page at Main, highlighted navigation bar](images/archive_main.png)

1. If either of the `Pages` are too small, the `adjustable divider` can be shifted to provide more space to either page!

    ![Adjustable Divider Vertical](images/adjustable_panel_vertical.png)
 
1. Likewise, if the `Result Display` is insufficient to display the feedback, its `divider` can also be shifted up! Take note the `Result Display` is scrollable too!

   ![Adjustable Divider Horizontal](images/adjustable_panel_horizontal.png)
    
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## Quick Start

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list case`** : Lists all unarchived `Cases`.

   * **`add case t:Kovan double murders`** : Adds a `Case` named `Kovan double murders` to PIVOT.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters supplied by the user. Words in `[SQUARE_BRACKETS]`(with square brackets) optional parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add case t:TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add case t:Kovan double murders`.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about duplicates:**<br>

* PIVOT does not allow the addition of `Case`, `Document`, `Suspect`, `Witness` or `Victim` that already exists.
* When editing details in PIVOT, if it results in duplicates, PIVOT will not allow it as well.
* `Cases` are identified by their `Title`. Users cannot add a `Case` if there is an existing `Case` (in either `Home`/`Archive` section) with the same `Title`. `Title` is a case-sensitive field.
* `Documents` are identified by both their `Name` and `Reference`. 
Users cannot add a `Document` to a `Case` if there is an existing `Document` with the same `Name` and `Reference` in that `Case`. `Name` is not a case-sensitive field.
* `Suspects`, `Witnesses`, `Victims` are identified by their `Name`, `Sex` and `Phone`. 
Users cannot add a `Suspect`/`Witness`/`Victim` to a `Case` if there is an existing `Suspect`/`Witness`/`Victim` with the same `Name`, `Sex` and `Phone` in that `Case`. `Name` is not a case-sensitive field.
* However, note that there can be duplicates between `Suspect`, `Witness` and `Victim` in a `Case`, and between different `Cases`. 
There can be a `Suspect` with the same `Name`, `Sex` and `Phone` as an existing `Victim`/`Witness` in that `Case` and vice versa.
The same `Suspect`/`Witness`/`Victim` can also appear in different cases.

Documents (name and reference that the users input on creation), `Suspects`/`Witnesses`/`Victims` (`Name`, `Sex`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`)
* Checks if the particular sequence of characters in the keyword matches e.g. keyword `Han` will match cases containing `Hans` in their details
* Cases matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. keywords `Hans Bo` will return case 
containing `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang` in their details.

Note that after doing a `find` command, if an `add case`, `delete case`, `archive case` (used in the `Home` section) 
or `unarchive case` (used in the `Archive` section) command is used, 
the list of cases will be updated to show the full list of cases in `Home` \ `Archive` section, depending on which section they are in.

#### Return to main page: `return`

### Both pages
The commands listed below can be used in the both pages of the app.

#### Undo: `undo`

Undoes the previous command. Open, list, find and return commands are unable to be undone.

Format: `undo`
- Undoing a `Case Command` will not show in the `Result Display` which unique `Case` the command was executed in.

#### Redo: `redo`

Redoes the command that was just undone. Open, list, find and return commands are unable to be redone. If another command that changes the data of PIVOT is used after an undo 
command, redo will not be able to be called.
- Redoing a `Case Command` will not show in the `Result Display` which unique `Case` the command was executed in.

Format: `redo`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about undo/redo:**<br>

If the command that is being undone/redone is a `main page command`, and if the application is currently on the case page,
using undo/redo will make the application return to the main page.<br>
e.g. `add case t:Lost Wallet` will add a new case to PIVOT. `open case 1` will open the first case in the list of cases,
and the application will now be at the case page. Using `undo` will undo the `add case t:Lost Wallet command`, which is
a `main page command`. This will bring the application back to the main page.

`Undo` has to be called before any `Redo` can be called. An `Undo` command itself cannot be undone. In order to restore the previous command that was undone, `redo` will have to be called. Likewise, a `redo` command itself cannot be undone as well. Calling `undo` after a `redo` will just restore PIVOT to the state where `undo` was initially called.
</div>

#### Help: `help`

Opens the Help Window. 

#### Exit application: `exit`

Exits the application.

### Data Management

#### Loading of User Data

User data automatically loads when user opens the app.

#### Saving of User Data

User data automatically saves when there is a change in data.
