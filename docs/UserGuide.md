## 1. Introduction

###### (written by: Ethan Rozario)

__Trackr__ is an application for teaching assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their
student records. It is uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you are a TA with a fast typing speed, __Trackr__ is the app for you! You can start by familiarising
yourself with the information regarding how this document is designed in
[Section 2, "About this document"](#2-about-this-document).

## 2. About this document

###### (written by: Ethan Rozario)

Welcome to the __Trackr__ User Guide! In this document you will be able to learn the features that __Trackr__ can
provide to make your TA experience less troublesome, by making data management, attendance tracking, and participation tracking a breeze. This section will provide information regarding the use of this document, namely how to navigate through this document, what the technical terms mean and how to interpret the
formatting used.

### 2.1 Glossary

The table below explains certain terms used in the document to describe different parts or aspects of the application.

| Term                           | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Graphical User Interface (GUI) | An interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations. |
| Command Line Interface (CLI)   | An interface that processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. |
| Command                        | An instruction typed by you, the user for **Trackr** to perform. |
| Field                          | A segment of a command that requires information to be filled into. |
| Parameter                      | The information filled by you, the user, into the field of a command. |
| Prefix                         | A short word that is typed right before you, the user, writes the parameter into the command. It always starts with a slash (/) and typically is an abbreviation of the name of the field. |
| Module                         | The specific course being taught in a University.        |
| Tutorial Group                 | The specific class being taught under a given module.        |
| Student                        | An individual who is enrolled in a given module.             |

### 2.2 Formatting

This document is written in a manner where formatting is applied to text in order to convey different meanings. The table below will explain what these formatting uses are, what they look like, and what they mean in the context of the document.

| Formatting                  | Meaning                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `code`                      | Words in 'code' format refer to commands (or fields in commands) that can be typed into the command line. |
| *Italics*                   | Words in italics refer to example parameters, which is what you, the user could type as the parameter that needs to be provided. |
| [Underline](#22-formatting) | Words that are in blue and underlined when hovered over refer to hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are clickable, and bring you either to different parts of this document or to external websites, for the convenience of navigating quickly to different parts of the document or the web. This example on the left will bring you to this section (2.2 Formatting). |
| **Bold**                    | The name of the application **Trackr** is written in bold to refer to what the application does or how it responds to user input. |

### 2.3 Command Format

Commands you provide in the command line follow specific rules. These are the rules you have to follow when typing commands for **Trackr** to read:

-   Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. <br>
    e.g. in `addMod m/MODULE_CODE`, MODULE_CODE is a parameter which can be used as `addMod m/CS3243`.
-   Items in square brackets are optional. <br>
    e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
-   Items with …  after them can be used multiple times including zero times. <br>
    e.g. `[t/TAG]…`  can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
-   Parameters can be in any order. <br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
-   Multiple instances of the same parameter will still be accepted, however, Trackr will only regard the **last instance** as the intended user input, except for tags. <br>
    e.g. 
    - `addMod m/CS3243 m/CS2100` will only add the module _CS2100_ to Trackr.
    - `editStudent 1 n/Johnny n/James` will edit the student's name to be _James_.
    - `addStudent n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com id/A1234567X t/CS2103T t/CS2100` will still add both tags to the newly added student _John Doe_.



## 3. Getting Started
###### (written by: Sean Tay)

### 3.1 Setting Up
Get started by installing __Trackr__ with the following steps:

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed. The latest version of Java can be found
[here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
2. Download the latest version of __Trackr__ [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/releases).
Look for the file trackr.jar.
3. Copy the file to a folder you wish to use as your home folder for __Trackr__
4. Double-click trackr.jar to start the app. The GUI (Figure 3.1) should appear in a few seconds.

![Ui](images/Ui.png) <br>
Figure 3.1a Trackr GUI

### 3.2 Using Trackr
__Trackr__ boasts many useful features to make using the app seamless and smooth. These include
commands to add or delete modules, tutorial groups, or students you are teaching. To use a feature, simply
type the command into the command box (see Figure 3.2) and press _Enter_ to execute it. Further explanations of
all the commands are listed in [Section 4, "Features"](#4-features).

![CommandExample](images/CommandExample.png) <br>
Figure 3.2a Command example

### 3.3 Switching Views
__Trackr__ allows you to switch the current view from Module View (Figure 3.3.1) to Tutorial Group View (Figure 3.3.2)
to Student View (Figure 3.3.3) depending on your current need. This is done using the commands `listMod`, `viewTG`, and
`viewStudent`. You may wish to navigate back from Student View to Tutorial Group View or from Tutorial Group View to
Module View. This is achieved using `prevView`. The correct syntax for these commands are shown in
[Section 4, "Features"](#4-features). The top of the app shows the view you are currently in.

#### 4.6.5 Edit a student's participation: `editParticipation`

Edits the participation score of a student by adding to or deducting from their existing score by the provided score.

Format: `editParticipation INDEX score/PARTICIPATION_SCORE`

> Note:
>
> - `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the Student view.
> - `INDEX` must be a positive integer starting from 1.
> - You can deduct score from a student by putting a negative number for `PARTICIPATION_SCORE` (e.g. Put -10 as `PARTICIPATION_SCORE` to deduct 10 score from a student)
> - `PARTICIPATION_SCORE` must be a whole number ranging from -100 to 100, using 0 will have no effect on the existing score.
> - Students can have a participation score from 0 to 100, adding or deducting score to one outside this range will cause the score to clip to the limits (e.g. Deducting 40 score from a student with a score of 30 will lead to the student having the score of 0 instead of -10)

Example:

- Adds 10 score to the first student on the student list.
  - `editParticipation 1 score/10`

Expected Outcome:
