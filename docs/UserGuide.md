## 1. Introduction (Luoyi)

As the information age encroaches out lives, our digital footprint has become larger and larger.
When we accumulate many files from work, school and daily lives,
we tend to spend a lot of time locating the files that we need.
In an Internation Data Corporation (IDC) [white paper](https://denalilabs.com/static/ProductivityWhitepaper.pdf)
published in 2012, a survey of 1200 information workers and IT professionals around the world
shows that they spend an average of 4.5 hours a week looking for documents. That is a lot of productivity time wasted!
This is where our solution, HelloFile, comes in.

*HelloFile* is a desktop application for professionals who have to manage a lot of files, specifically **tech savvy CS2103T CS students**.
It is optimised for use under Command Line Interface (CLI).
By using our application, you can tag frequently used files/folders with a short nickname, and open them
with a single command. We hope by using our application, you can manage your files easily. Moreover, you can
make your life easier one file at a time, and free up your precious time to spend on things you truly enjoy.

4. Below the *Result Panel* is the *Command History*. It shows your last command entered.
5. The *Command Box* at the bottom of the app window. You can type your commands here and hit enter to execute your command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4 Basic Workflow (Li Shuo - Writing, Heinrich - Screenshot)
To use HelloFile effectively, we recommend the following workflow.

1. Tag important files with the `tag` command for ease of access.<br>
![Tag](images/screenshots/tag.PNG) <br><br>
2. When trying to access tagged files, instead of navigating to the file location, simply use the `open` command to access the required files.<br>
![Open](images/screenshots/open.PNG) <br><br>
3. To find the location of tagged files, use the `show` command to get the file path of the file.<br>
![Show](images/screenshots/show.PNG) <br><br>
4. If you have made a mistake, you can recover by using `undo` and `redo`.<br>
![Undo](images/screenshots/undo.PNG) <br>
![Redo](images/screenshots/redo.PNG) <br><br>
5. To exit the application, either close the application window, or use the `exit` command.

## 4. Features (All members)

There are many file management features in *HelloFile*.
We will explain them in detail in this section.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `tag t>TAG`, `TAG` is a parameter, such as in the case `add t>Myfile`.

* Expressions in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `t>TAG [f>FILE_PATH]` can be used as `t>Myfile f>C:\Users` or as `t>Myfile`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specify `t>TAG f>FILE_PATH`, `f>FILE_PATH t>TAG` is also an acceptable command.

* Expressions with `...` at the end can be provided any number of times.<br>
  e.g. `t>TAG [l>LABEL]...` can be used as `t>TAG`, `t>TAG l>label`, or `t>TAG l>label1 l>label2 l>label3`.
  
* Every tag name must be unique, but multiple tags can point to the same filepath.

* Every tag name is case-sensitive. e.g tag name `notes` is different from tag name `Notes`.

* Only the `cd` and `tag` command accepts relative file path, all other commands require absolute file path.

* For MacOS and Linux users, your file path may be slightly different from the examples given.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Warning for multiple expressions**

Expressions without `...` at the end takes the last parameter as the argument when provided with multiple same expressions.<br>
  e.g. `tag t>TAG1 t>TAG2` will take `TAG2` as the parameter, ignoring the parameter `TAG1`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.1 Adding a tag: `tag` (Anthony)

Tags a file with a unique tag name and optionally, some labels.

With this command, you can add a nickname, or "tag", to a file.
You can get a reference to that file using the same tag in every subsequent access.
For example, you can use the [`open`](#43-accessing-a-tagged-file--open) command to open the file that you have tagged.

Additionally, you can add short descriptors, or "labels" as well.
Labels serve to categorise tags. If you have multiple tags with the same label, you can open them all at once using the
`open` command.

**Please take note of the following:**
* You can add any number of labels to the tag (including 0).
* The `FILE_PATH` field can accept both absolute and relative file path from your current directory.
The internal File Explorer of HelloFile indicates the current folder for the relative path.
* Please make sure you have read permission for the file that you want to tag.
You can tag a file without access permission. However, you will not be able to open them.

**Format:** `tag t>TAG_NAME f>FILE_PATH [l>LABEL]...`

**Adding a new tag named `duke`:**
![tag](images/screenshots/tag_command.png)

**Examples:**
* `tag t>Tag1 f>C:\Users` (Adds a tag `Tag1` using absolute path. The tag has no label and points to `C:\Users`)
* `tag t>Tag2 f>C:\Users l>Important` (Adds a tag `Tag2` using absolute path. The tag has a label `important` and points to`C:\Users`)
* `tag t>Tag3 f>Users` (Adds a tag `Tag3` using relative path. The tag has no label and points to a folder `Users` in the current directory)
* `tag t>Tag4 f>Users l>folder l>readonly` (Adds a tag `Tag4` using relative path. The tag has labels `folder` and `readonly`. It points to a folder `Users` in the current directory)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2 Displaying information of a tagged file : `show` (Anthony)

* This command only accepts one tag or one label but not both.
* Please ensure that you have read permission for the files that you want to open.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 6. FAQ (Li Shuo, Anthony)
**Q**: What if the name or the directory of the file I tagged is changed? Can I still access the file using HelloFile?<br>
**A**: No. HelloFile is currently unable to track a file if you make changes to the file's name or directory.
You will need to delete the old tag or retag the file.

**Q**: What is the structure of the application?<br>
**A**: You can find it in the Developer Guide [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md)

**Q**: How do I report a bug?<br>
**A**: Please create a new issue on [this](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/issues) webpage.

**Q**: Can I contribute to the project?<br>
**A**: Sorry, as this is a school project, we are not accepting any contributors at this period.

**Q**: Why does list command use `ls` as the keyword instead of `list`? <br>
**A**: In most terminals, `ls` is the default keyword for listing files and folders. We would like the transition 
from terminal to HelloFile to be as smooth as possible for our target users.
