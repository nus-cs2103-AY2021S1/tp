<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add a/AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT` is a parameter which can be used as `add a/100`.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional (zero or one instance).<br>
  e.g `a/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY [t/date]` can be used as `a/100 c/shopping` or as `a/100 c/shopping t/2020-10-30`
  
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `a/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY`, `c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT` is also acceptable.
  
* Multiple instances of the same prefix/flag will not throw an error. However, the app will only read the <b>last instance</b> in the input.
  e.g. if `add a/100 c/entertainment c/food` will add the expense to "food" category.
  
* All additional input after commands which do not have input fields such as list, exit, clear, etc. will be ignored.
eg. `help` and `help 123` will have the same effect.

* Prefixes are case-sensitive.
eg. `d/` is not the same as `D/`.
  e.g. if the command specifies `a/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY, c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT` is also acceptable.
  
* Here are the prefix used in our command.
  *   a/ : amount
  *   c/ : category
  *   t/ : date of expenses
  *   d/ : description for the expenses
  *   cc/ : currency code of currency

* Pop up windows for <b>help</b>, <b>show-stats</b>, <b>show-rates</b>, <b>show-codes</b> commands can be closed with keyboard shortcut "<b>q</b>".
