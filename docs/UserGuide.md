### 3.1 Command Features

Things to note for the commands:
* Commands with suffix of `-i` refer to `item` related commands, while those with suffix of `-d` refer to `delivery` related commands. <br>
  e.g. `add-i` is used to add an `item` and `add-d` is used to add a `delivery`
  
  <a name="index"></a>
* In the format of commands, `INDEX` refers to the numbering that is displayed.
  <br> 
  
  ![Index](images/Index.png)
  <br>
  Figure 3: Index Annotation
  <br>

* In the format of commands, words in `UPPER_CASE` are what you would input.<br>
  e.g. for a command with format `add-i n/NAME q/QUANTITY`, <br>
  replace `NAME` and `QUANTITY` with your input: `add-i n/Chicken q/10`.

* In the format of commands, square brackets are to indicate optional fields. The fields in the square brackets are not mandatory to input.<br>
  e.g a command with format `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as 
  1. either `n/Chicken t/Poultry` 
  1. or just `n/Chicken`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times in the same command or not at all.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used 
  1. once: `t/brother`
  1. or multiple times: `t/sibling t/brother t/family`

* Fields in the commands can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. a command with format `add-i n/NAME q/QUANTITY` can be used as

#### 3.1.2 Adding an item or delivery: `add-i` or `add-d`

Adds inventory item or pending delivery to **OneShelf**.

##### 3.1.2.a `add-i`

Format: `add-i n/NAME q/QUANTITY [s/SUPPLIER] [max/MAX_QUANTITY] [metric/METRIC] [t/TAG]...​`
* If item does not exist in the inventory book, a new item will be added.
* If similar inventory item already exist, The `QUANTITY` of that particular item will be increased.
* An item which has the same `NAME` and `SUPPLIER` is considered similar.
* `MAX_QUANTITY` denotes the ideal stock level of that particular item.
* `TAG` could be used to categorise items. EG: Duck can be tagged as meat. 

<a name="addexample1"></a>
Example 1: Add an item using [Figure 1](#uiwithannotationpng) data set as the starting point.


1. Type `add-i n/DUCK q/10 s/NTUC max/50 metric/KG t/meat t/food` in the [Command Box](#uiwithannotationpng).

2. Either press Enter on your keyboard or click Send to execute the command.

<br>
Figure 5: Add new item of duck
<br>

4. Press key arrow up on your keyboard to toggle to previous command and press Enter. Your command should not pass 
through as you are not allowed to add with max quantity and metric. You should receive an error message as shown below:

are adding to an existing `item` DUCK which was just added. Furthermore, a new tag of perishable should also appear.
You can refer to the diagram below for the expected result:
<br>
![add-i_step3](images/add-i_eg1.3.PNG)
<br>
Figure 7: Successfully added quantity with new tag

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:**Tip:**

#### 3.1.6 Listing all items or delivery: `list-i` or `list-d`

After entering `find-i` or `find-d`, the placeholder in your application will only show the items or deliveries
that match your find KEYWORD. If you would like to show **all** the items and deliveries again,
`list-i` or `list-d` command would be useful.

Format: `list-i` or `list-d`



#### 3.1.7 Deleting an item or delivery: `delete-i` or `delete-d`

Deletes an item or delivery from inventory book or delivery book respectively. Delete command is especially useful
for delivery as you would often need to delete a pending delivery once it has been delivered.

Format: `undo`

* If there is a previous state available, the current state is reverted to that state
* If the current state is the earliest possible one, it shows a message informing the user that there is nothing more to undo
* The maximum number of previous commands you can undo is 20

<a name="undoExample1"></a>Example 1: `undo` using [Figure 1](#uiwithannotationpng) as the starting point.

1. Select the Command box and type in `clear-i`

2. Either press Enter on your keyboard or click Send to execute the command.
<br>
![edit-i example one step three](images/undo%20example%20one%20step%20two.png)
<br>
<br>

4. Repeat step 2
* You should now see the same items as appearing in [Figure 1](#uiwithannotationpng)



#### 3.1.10 Redo last command: `redo`

Redoes the last undone command by reverting the current data displayed to the state it was in before the last undo command was executed.

Format: `redo`

* If there is an undone state available, the current state is reverted to that state
* If the current state is the latest possible one, it shows a message informing the user that there is nothing more to redo
* After any command that changes the state of data (such as add, clear, delete, edit), the new state becomes the latest state
(i.e. the previous undo commands are "forgotten" and `redo` will have no effect)

Example 1: `redo` using [Figure 1](#uiwithannotationpng) as the starting point.

1. Follow steps 1 - 4 of [Example 1](#undoExample1) for the `undo` command

<a name="undoExample1Step2"></a>
2. Select the Command box and type in `undo`

3. Either press Enter on your keyboard or click Send to execute the command
