## Introduction

Do you even find yourself struggling to manage all the different kinds of module information that you have to track? Are there too 
many modules, contacts, tasks and events to remember? Well, do not worry, CAP5Buddy is here to help.

CAP5Buddy is a desktop application that helps NUS SoC students to keep track of their module details efficiently.
It helps you to centralize key module details, contacts and information while following your study progress. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the 
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CAP5Buddy can help you manage your module 
details and information more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

Some common symbols that can be found in the user guide and their meanings:

* :information_source: Represents useful information that should be noted.

* :bulb: Represents a useful tip.

* :warning: Represents a warning that users should be aware of.



<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addtask n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addtask n/Week 11 quiz`.

* Items in square brackets are optional. Items without square brackets are compulsory fields. <br>
  e.g. `addtask n/NAME [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `addtask n/Week 11 quiz p/highest` or as `addtask n/Week 11 quiz`

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. <br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `   ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/easy`, `t/friend t/important` etc.

* Argument parameters can be provided in any order, unless one of the parameter is `INDEX`, in which case `INDEX`has to be the first parameter.
  e.g. if the command specifies `edittask INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PRIORITY]`, then `edittask INDEX [p/PRIORITY] [n/NAME]` is also acceptable, but
  `edittask [n/NAME] INDEX [p/PRIORITY]` is not allowed.

* If you enter duplicate parameters when the command format does not expect multiple occurrence of the same parameter, i.e.
  parameters without `...` at the back in the command format (e.g. n/NAME), the application will only consider the argument of the last
  occurring duplicate parameter.
  e.g. in `addtask n/Week 11 quiz n/Lab assignment`, `n/Week 11 quiz` will be ignored and a task with the name `Lab assignment` will be added.

</div>


### Module Tracker Features

#### Adding a new module: `addmodule`

Creates and add a new module to be stored in the system.

  Format: `addmodule n/MODULE_NAME [t/TAG]...` 

  * You can only key in the module code for the `MODULE_NAME`. Invalid module codes, such as `CS2103TT` will not be accepted.

  * The module code you input must be **capitalised**, eg. `cs2103t` will be rejected while `CS2103T` is correct.

   Example :
   * `addmodule n/CS2103T` creates and adds the module CS2103T.
   
Expected Outcome: 
  
<p aligin="center"><img src="images/addmodule.png" border="2px solid black"></p>
  
  Other helpful example(s):

   * `addmodule n/CS2103T t/Coremodule` creates and adds the module CS2103T with the tag _CoreModule_.

#### Adding a new completed module: `addcmodule`

Creates and add a new completed module to be stored in the system.

  Format: `addcmodule n/NAME mc/MODULAR_CREDITS gp/GRADE_POINT [t/TAG]...`

   * Using this command to add a completed module will automatically tag the module as completed.
   * Completed modules can be modified using `editmodule`. Do note that editing tags will reset all existing tags, therefore in order to keep the completed tag after editing, you must specify the completed tag parameter in the `editmodule` command by adding `t/completed` to your command line exactly.
   * Completed modules added this way will be used for CAP calculation purposes.

   Examples:
   * `addcmodule n/CS2103T mc/4.0 gp/5.0` creates and adds the module named CS2103T with 4 modular credits
      and 5 grade points with a `completed` tag.
   * `addcmodule n/CS2101 mc/2.0 gp/4.5 t/year1` creates and adds the module named CS2101 with 2 modular credits
      and 4.5 grade points with the tags `completed` and `year1`.

#### Viewing a module: `viewmodule`

Displays a snapshot of a module stored in the system.

 Format: `viewmodule` `INDEX`
    
  * The module viewed will be at the `INDEX` position of the current displayed list.

  * The index refers to the index number of the module shown on the displayed module list.

  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3...
  
  * Clicking on the `ZoomLink` displayed(if any) will copy the `ZoomLink` into your clipboard.
  
  * Note that the displayed snapshot is not updated when the module being displayed is changed.

  Example:
   * `viewmodule 1` views the first module in the displayed list.

### Zoom link management feature

The following features allow you to manage the zoom links for your respective modules and perform various zoom link related functions. 

The section below provides some useful details about the zoom list management features.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br> 
As zoom links are only displayed on the **additional information display panel**, and not the main item display panel,
to view all your zoom links, you can use the `viewmodule INDEX` command, where `INDEX` refers to the index of the module with the zoom links.

**:information_source: Note:**<br> 
To view changes or updates made to zoom links, you should use the command `viewmodule INDEX`, where `INDEX` refers to 
the index of the module with the zoom links, after executing the zoom link command.
e.g. `addzoom 1 n/lecture z/https://nus-sg.zoom.us/j/huf7r3` followed by `viewmodule 1`
                         
**:information_source: Note:** <br>
Each lesson in a module will only be allowed to have one zoom link,
i.e. you will not be allowed to add multiple zoom links to the same lesson.                         

</div>

#### Zoom link command parameters
