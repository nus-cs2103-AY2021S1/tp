## 1. Introduction

Hello, fellow clinic administrative staff.

Welcome to **Hospify**, a desktop application for a digital medical record management solution. With **Hospify**, you will be able to add, edit, find, delete and sort (and more!) patients' medical record and even appointment details. In this user guide, you will learn more about how to get started with **Hospify** and how you can use the key features of the application.

**Hospify** is primarily optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means most features can be used by just typing a single line of command! If you can type fast, you will be able to manage medical records much more efficiently. However, if you are new to **Hospify**, fret not! Read on to find out what **Hospify** can offer.

Before we move on to how to install **Hospify**, let us understand how the user guide works!

To navigate around this user guide, you may use the hyperlinks provided at the top of the page to jump to a particular section that you are interested in. This user guide is divided into 4 major sections: Quick Start, Features (contains sub section, each representing a feature of **Hospify**), Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Command Summary. The following explains the key notations used in this user guide:

1. `text in box` - represents a command, action, input, output or file

1. **:information_source: Notes:** - represents noteworthy information

1. **:bulb: Tip:** - represents a useful tip

1. **:warning: Important:** - represents important warnings

## 2. Quick start

In this section, we will be going through the process of installing **Hospify** on your computer and some of the necessary pre-requisites. Before we start the installation, please ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. If not, you may download Java `11` from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features

In this section, we will be looking at a series of commands that **Hospify** supports, how you can use these commands, why these commands may be helpful to you and the expected outcomes of executing these commands. You may refer to the table of contents at the top of this page to skip to the specific command that you are interested in.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you have to provide when typing a command.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional parameters.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/ALLERGIES]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/shellfish` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[t/ALLERGIES]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/shellfish`, `t/shellfish t/grass` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME ic/ NRIC p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME ic/S1234567A` is also acceptable.
</div>

### 3.2 Adding a patient: `add` (by Cedric Lim Jun Wei)

This is a core and basic feature of **Hospify**. This command allows you to add a new patient to **Hospify**. Start by typing the command word `add`, followed by the following items:

1. `n/NAME` : Name of patient

2. `ic/NRIC` : Nric of patient

3. `p/PHONE_NUMBER` : Phone number of patient

4. `e/EMAIL` : Email of patient

5. `a/ADDRESS` : Home address of patient

6. `mr/MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` : Url to the patient's online medical record

7. `t/ALLERGIES` : Known allergies of the patient

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Important note on the fields:**<br>

* All items except items 4 and 7 are compulsory fields that you have to provide. Missing any one of those fields will trigger an error.

* Items 4 and 7 are optional items that you may choose to exclude. In addition, for item 7, you may choose to include more than one of such item by using `t/ALLERGIES` again.

* You are **not allowed** to add patients with the same `NRIC` or `MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` field as an existing patient in **Hospify**. However, it is possible to do so for the other fields.
</div>

Let us summarise the information above to a single line of command in the following format.

Format: `add n/NAME ic/NRIC p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] a/ADDRESS mr/MEDICAL_RECORD_URL [t/ALLERGIES]…​`

* The `NAME` (upper limit of 100 characters) and `ALLERGIES` (upper limit of 100 characters) field should contain alphanumeric characters.
* The `NRIC` field should start with an alphabet, followed by 7 digits, before ending with another alphabet.
* The `PHONE_NUMBER` field should contain a number that is between 3 and 15 digits (inclusive) long.
* The `EMAIL` field should contain a valid email address (for more information on email validity, please refer to the [Command Summary](#5-command-summary)).
* The `ADDRESS` (upper limit of 200 characters) field can contain any word or number.
* The `MEDICAL_RECORD` field should contain a valid url (for more information on url validity, please refer to the [Command Summary](#5-command-summary)).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** A patient can have any number of allergies (including 0)
</div>

Let us use some examples (as shown below) to see how this command can actually be used.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe ic/S1234567A p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 mr/www.samplerecord.com/11`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe ic/S9425431A t/shellfish e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/grass mr/www.samplerecord.com/02`

When a patient is successfully added to **Hospify**, a success message will appear in the message box, and the patient is shown at the bottom of the list as shown in figure 3.1 below. <br>

![Add patient](images/AddPatient.PNG)
Figure 3.1 Adding a patient (success scenario)

### 3.3 Listing all patients: `list` (by Cedric Lim Jun Wei)

This command allows you to display the complete list of patients recorded in **Hospify**. This may be useful after you have used the [`find`](#35-locating-patients-by-name-or-nric-find-by-gabriel-teo-yu-xiang) command (which displays a partial list of patients) and you wish to revert back to the complete list of patients again.

To use the command, simply type in `list` on the command line with no additional parameters.

Format: `list`

In the example below, we first use the `find` command to search for patient `Bernice Yu`. To do so, we type `find Bernice Yu` on the command line. This results in a partial list containing only one patient as shown in figure 4.1 below.

![Find patient](images/ListPatient1.PNG)
Figure 4.1 Finding patient `Bernice Yu`

With the help of the `list` command, we can revert back to the complete list of patients as shown in figure 4.2 below.

![List patients](images/ListPatient2.PNG)
Figure 4.2 Listing all patients

### 3.4 Editing a patient: `edit` (by Cao Qin)

This command allows you to edit an existing patient in **Hospify**, it is especially useful when the patients' information changes and you want to update it in the system. 

To use this command, simply type in `edit` and the fields of the patient you want to edit, as specified by the format below.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [mr/MEDICAL_RECORD_URL] [t/ALLERGIES]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* The meaning of each field in the above format is the same as in the `add` command, you can refer to the [**`add` command**](#32-adding-a-patient-add-by-cedric-lim-jun-wei).
For your convenience, specifications for each field are also provided below.

</div>

* The `INDEX` refers to the index number of the patient as shown in the displayed patient list, and it **must be a positive integer**, such as 1, 2, 3, …​
* The `NRIC` field should start with an alphabet, followed by 7 digits, before ending with another alphabet.
* The `NAME` and `ALLERGIES` fields should only contain alphanumeric characters, and they have an upper limit of 100 characters. 
* The `PHONE_NUMBER` field should contain a number that is between 3 and 15 digits (inclusive) long.
* The `EMAIL` field should contain a valid email address (to find more information on email validation, please check the [Command Summary](#5-command-summary)).
* The `ADDRESS` field should only contain alphanumeric characters, and its total length should not exceed 200 characters.
* The `MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` field should contain a valid URL (to find more information on URL validation, please check the [Command Summary](#5-command-summary)).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Important notes:**<br>

* Except for the `INDEX` field, all other fields are optional.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* After editing a field, the old value of that field will be deleted from the system and replaced by the new input value.
* When editing allergies, the existing allergies of the patient will be removed i.e adding of allergies is not cumulative.
* You are **not allowed** to edit the `NRIC` or `MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` field of a patient to the same as another existing patient's in **Hospify**. However, it is possible to do so for other fields.

</div>

To help you better understand how to use the `edit` command, here are some examples below.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st patient to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd patient to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing allergies.
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>

* You can remove all the patient’s allergies by typing `t/` without
    specifying any allergies after it.
    
</div>

When a patient is successfully edited in **Hospify**, a success message will appear in the message box, and the edited patient will be updated in the list as shown in figure 5.1 below. <br>
![Edit patient](images/editPatient.png)

### 3.5 Locating patients by name or Nric: `find` (by Gabriel Teo Yu Xiang)

This command allows you to find patients whose names contain any of the given keywords or NRICs.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] [NRIC] [MORE_NRICs]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`, and `s1234567a` will match `S1234567A`
* The order of the keywords or NRICs does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Both the name and NRIC are searched.
* Patients matching at least one keyword or NRIC will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo S7654321A` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`, `Tom Lee` (whose NRIC is S7654321A)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`

* Only full NRICs will be matched e.g. `S12345` will not match `S1234567A`
</div>

After executing the command, a message will appear showing the number of patients found, as well as the patients in the list displayed as shown in figures 6.1 and 6.2 below.

Examples:
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)
  Figure 6.1 Finding patients `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`

* `find bernice s0000003a` returns `Bernice Yu`, `Charlotte Oliveiro`
  ![result for 'find bernice s0000003a'](images/findbernices0000003aResult.png)
  Figure 6.2 Finding patients `Bernice Yu` and `Charlotte Oliveiro`

### 3.6 Deleting a patient: `delete` (by Cao Qin)

This command allows you to delete a specific patient from **Hospify**. As a converse of `add` command, `delete` command might 
be useful when you find a patient's information will no longer be used in the system and want to remove it. 

To use this command, simply type in `delete` and the `INDEX` or `NRIC` of the patient you want to delete, as specified in the format below. 

Format: `delete INDEX` or `delete NRIC`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about `delete` command:**<br>
* `delete` command deletes the patient at the specified `INDEX` or `NRIC`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number of the patient as shown in the displayed patient list, and it must be a **positive integer**, such as 1, 2, 3, …​
* The `NRIC` refers to the `NRIC` field of the patient to be deleted. It should start with an alphabet, followed by 7 digits, before ending with another alphabet.
* The `NRIC` entered is **case-insensitive**. e.g. `s1234567a` will match `S1234567A`
* Only full `NRIC`s will be matched e.g. `S12345` will **not** match `S1234567A`
* When a patient is successfully deleted from **Hospify**, a success message will appear in the message box, and the deleted patient will disappear from the displayed patient list.
</div>

To help you get more familiar with the `delete` command, here are some examples of using this command, as shown below.

Examples:

scenario 1 (delete by index):

* `list`(shown in Figure 7.1 below) followed by `delete 2`(shown in Figure 7.2 below) deletes the 2nd patient in **Hospify**'s patient list.

  `list` command shows all the patients and their corresponding index.
  ![result for 'list'](images/listResult.png)
  Figure 7.1 result of `list` command
  
  `delete 2` command deletes the patient with index 2. 
  ![result for 'delete 2'](images/deleteTwoResult.png)
  Figure 7.2 result of `delete 2` command

scenario 2 (delete by nric):

* `delete S0000004A`(shown in Figure 7.3 below) deletes `David Li` (whose NRIC is S0000004A).

  ![result for 'delete S0000004A'](images/deleteDavidResult.png)
  Figure 7.3 result of `delete S0000004A` command

### 3.7 Counting total number of patients: `count` (by Chong Jia Le)

This command allows you to see the total number of patients recorded in **Hospify**.

To use this command, simply type in `count` on the command line with no additional parameters.

Format: `count`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* The total number of patients will always be provided, and not the number of patients currently displayed in the list.

</div>

Example:

![Count example](images/CountExample.PNG)
Figure 8.1 Result of `count` command

### 3.8 Sorting the patients: `sort` (by Chong Jia Le)

This function allows you to sort the patients in **Hospify**. The sort can be performed by either name or NRIC and it will be sorted in ascending order.
Using this command after you have used the `find` command, which displays a partial list of patient, would allow you to sort the partial list.

To use this command, simply type in `sort` on the command line followed by either `name` or `NRIC` depending on how you want the patients to be sorted.

Format: `sort name` or `sort NRIC`

Examples:

* Performing `sort name` would result in the patients to be sorted by their name in ascending order, as shown in the steps below.

    1. Initially, list of patients is not sorted by name as seen below:
        
        ![Sort Nric example](images/SortNric0.png)
        Figure 9.1 List of patients not sorted by name
        
    2. After user inputs `sort name` list is sorted as seen below:
        
        ![Sort Name example](images/SortName.PNG)
        Figure 9.2 List of patients after `sort name`

* Performing `sort NRIC` would result in the patients to be sorted by their NRIC in ascending order, as shown in the steps below.
    
    1. Initially, list of patients is not sorted by NRIC as seen below:
        
        ![Sort Nric example](images/SortName0.png)

    2. After user inputs `sort NRIC` list is sorted as seen below:
        
        ![Sort Name example](images/SortNric.PNG)
        Figure 9.4 List of patients after `sort NRIC`
        
* Performing `find amy` followed by `sort name` would result in the app displaying all patients whose names contain `amy` sorted in alphabetical order by their name.
    
    1. `find amy` is performed resulting in the application showing only patients whose names contain `amy` as shown below:
  
        ![Sort Find example 1](images/SortFind.PNG)
        Figure 9.5 Partial list of patients after `find amy`

### 3.9 Showing Appointments of a Patient: `showAppt` (by Peh Jun Siang)

The `showAppt` command shows you all the appointments of a patient in a table for ease of viewing.
Unlike other commands, you can click on the patient's information to show the appointments **without needing to enter any commands**.

###### 3.9.1 Using the `GUI`
You can simply **double click** on the patient to display all the appointments of that patient.

![show appointments via gui](images/showAppt/showAppt_gui.PNG)
Figure 10.1 Show appointments via GUI

###### 3.9.2 Using the `Command Line`
If the number of patients is too large, it might be difficult to find the patient's information to click.
In that case, you can use the command line to show the patient's appointments.

![show appointments via command line](images/showAppt/showAppt_input.PNG)\
Figure 10.2 Show appointments via Command Line

Format: `showAppt NRIC`

Example: `showAppt S1234567A`

### 3.10 Adding an Appointment: `addAppt` (by Gabriel Teo Yu Xiang)

This command allows you to schedule an `Appointment` for a patient in **Hospify**.

Format: `addAppt NRIC appt/DATE TIME [d/DESCRIPTION]`

* `NRIC` represents the `NRIC` of the patient you are adding an `Appointment` to.
* `DATE` and `TIME` represent the date and time of the `Appointment` respectively.
* `DESCRIPTION` represents the name or brief description of the `Appointment`.
  e.g. `Eye Check-up` or `Physiotherapy Session`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

### 3.12 Deleting an Appointment: `deleteAppt` (by Gabriel Teo Yu Xiang)

This command allows you to delete an existing `Appointment` for a patient in **Hospify**.

Format: `deleteAppt NRIC appt/DATE TIME`

* The `Appointment` to delete must be an existing appointment of the patient.
* The `Appointment` name/description does not need to be specified, since **Hospify** does not allow multiple appointments of the same timing for the same patient, and every appointment will have a unique timing.
* `NRIC` represents the `NRIC` of the patient whose `Appointment` you are deleting.
* `DATE` and `TIME` represent the date and time of the `Appointment` to be deleted.
* `DATE` and `TIME` formats follow the same format as specified in the [`addAppt`](#310-adding-an-appointment-addappt-by-gabriel-teo-yu-xiang) command section.

Example:
* `deleteAppt S0000001A appt/28/09/2022 20:00`

When an `Appointment` is successfully deleted, a success message will appear in the message box, and the number of upcoming appointments will be updated and reflected as shown in figure 13.1 below.<br>

### 3.13 Using the Medical Record feature: `mr/` (by Cedric Lim Jun Wei)

By now we have learnt that we can [`add`](#32-adding-a-patient-add-by-cedric-lim-jun-wei) and [`edit`](#34-editing-a-patient-edit-by-cao-qin) patients by including the `mr/MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` field. Recall that this is a compulsory field for the `add` command while it is an optional field for the `edit` command and we can summarise the command formats as shown below.

Format: `add n/NAME …​ mr/MEDICAL_RECORD_URL …​` or `edit INDEX …​ [mr/MEDICAL_RECORD_URL] …​`

Example: `add n/John Doe …​ mr/www.samplemedicalrecord.com/01 …​` or `edit 1 …​ mr/www.samplemedicalrecord.com/02 …​`

With this field, you can store the url to the online medical record of the patient and can access this url in the patient's tab whenever necessary. Now, let us explore how we can make use of this feature to edit patients' online medical record.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note on choice of medical record url:**<br>

* It is helpful to generate the medical record url before adding or editing a patient.

* We recommend using a secure online documenting software to store the patients' medical record for privacy purposes.
</div>

In the following example, we will be using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) to store the medical record of patient `John Doe`.

1. First, we add patient `John Doe` using the `add` command. For this step, we will be using the url `https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cWm83218iwKEzNHP41vHFWLukaDn6eYompjyCcJxBiA/edit`. Upon successful addition, you should be able to see a success message including the `MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` you have just added when you scroll the message box to the bottom as shown in figure 14.1 below.<br>
    
    ![medical record example 1](images/MrUrl1.PNG)
    Figure 14.1 Adding patient John Doe
    
1. Next, to copy the medical record url of patient `John Doe` that we have just added, locate the patient in the list and click on the `MR URL` button located on the bottom right corner as shown in figure 14.2 below. A `Link Copied!` success message should appear once clicked, indicating that the link has been copied to the system clipboard.<br>
    
    ![medical record example 2](images/MrUrl2.PNG)
    Figure 14.2 Copying medical record url of John Doe
    
1. Then, open the web browser of your choice and paste the medical record url onto the search bar as shown in figure 14.3 below.<br>
    
    ![medical record example 3](images/MrUrl3.PNG)
    Figure 14.3 Pasting medical record url of John Doe onto search bar
    
1. Finally, you can access the medical record of the patient and make edits if applicable. A sample medical record is shown in figure 14.4 below for your reference.<br>
    
    ![medical record example 4](images/MrUrl4.png)
    Figure 14.4 Sample medical record of John Doe on Google Docs

The example we have just discussed uses the `add` command. The usage of the `MEDICAL_RECORD_URL` field in `edit` works in the same way as described in the `add` example as well.

Another method to access the online medical record of the patient directly (without the copy-and-paste mechanism) is shown in the [`showMr`](#314-show-medical-record-directly-showmr-by-peh-jun-siang) command section below.

### 3.14 Show medical record directly: `showMr` (by Peh Jun Siang)
We understand that it might be quite a hassle to copy the URL and paste it in your browser manually. Therefore, we
implemented a short cut so that you can open up your default browser with the URL to the medical record directly from **Hospify** with the `showMr`
command!

Format: `showMr NRIC`\
Example: `showMr s1234567A`

Running the command as shown below will open your computer's **default browser** with the patient's medical record.
![showMr command](images/showMrExample.PNG)
Figure 15.1 Using the `showMr` command to open patient's medical record.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

In the unlikely event that `showMr` command does not open up the medical record in your default browser,
use the **manual method** described in [the above section](#313-using-the-medical-record-feature-mr-by-cedric-lim-jun-wei)
on the medical record feature.

**:warning: Important:** - Check that your URL is valid if the medical record does not open on your browser.

Depending on the `Operating System` you are using, the `showMr` command may not work 
sometimes because there might be some issues with your default browser. Do drop us an email
at **hospify_enquiry@gmail.com** to notify the tech team if it does not open on your browser.

### 3.15 Clearing all entries: `clear` (by Cao Qin)

This command allows you to clear all patients' information from **Hospify**. It is very useful when you want to clear all the sample data in the system and start using **Hospify** in your own clinic!

To use this command, simply type in `clear`, and all the patients' information will be removed from the system.

Format: `clear`

To help you understand this command, here is an example of using it, as shown below.

Example: 

execute `clear`(shown in Figure 16.1 below) command will empty the patient list (shown in Figure 16.2 below).

![clear command](images/clear%20command.png)
Figure 16.1 clear command

![clear command result](images/clear%20command%20result.png)
Figure 16.2 clear command result

### 3.16 Exiting the program: `exit` 

You can exit the program by typing `exit` on the command line. Alternatively, you can close the window directly. Don't worry, either way, your data is automatically saved in the program!

Format: `exit`

### 3.17 Saving the data

**Hospify** data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
