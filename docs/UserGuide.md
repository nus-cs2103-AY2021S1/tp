## Notes about the command format

This section will give you some useful information about the various command formats and notations you will see in [Features](#features).
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">


* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  * eg. in `add q/QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add q/What is my name?`<br><br>

* Items in angle brackets `<>` are either/or options. Each option is delineated by a `|` .
  * eg. `<success|reviewed>` can be used as either `success` or `reviewed` but not both.<br><br>

* Words in lower_case are to be specified exactly.
  * eg. in `sort <success|reviewed>`, `success` and `reviewed` must be specified exactly.<br><br>

* Items in square brackets are optional (zero or one instance).
  * eg. `q/QUESTION [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `q/What is my name?` or as `q/What is my name? c/topic 1`<br><br>

* Items in square brackets with trailing ellipsis are optional (zero, one or multiple instances).
  * eg. `q/QUESTION [t/TAG]...` can be used as `q/What is my name?`, `q/What is my name? t/topic1` or
  `q/What is my name? t/topic1 t/fun`
  * Multiple instances of the tag prefix is accepted, and the app will read every instance
    in the input.<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Multiple instances of the same prefix/flag will not throw an error. However, the app will only read the **last instance** in the input (except for tags).
  * eg. `add q/Are apples red? a/Yes c/fruit c/test` will add a flashcard belonging to "test" category
  * eg. `sort reviewed -a -a -d` will sort flashcards according to review frequency in **descending** order
  * eg. `filter f/yes f/no` will filter and list flashcards that are not favourited.<br><br>
  
* Parameters can be in any order.
  * eg. Specifying `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER` or `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` are both acceptable.<br><br>
  
* All additional input after commands which do not have input fields such as `list`, `exit`, `clear`, `help`, `review`, `quiz` will be ignored.
  * eg. `list` and `list 123` will have the same effect.<br><br>

* Flags such as `-a` and `-d` allow white spaces within them.
  * eg. `sort success -   a` is valid and will sort flashcards by success rate in ascending order.
  * eg. `view 1 -  a` is valid and will view the first flashcard in the displayed flashcard list with answer shown.<br><br>

* Prefixes and flags are both case sensitive.
  * eg. `q/` is not the same as `Q/`
  * eg. `-a` is not the same as `-A`

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Common Input Fields

This section will help you understand the different fields you will see in [Features](#features). It gives an overview of what they are, how to specify them and any restrictions.

#### General Notes about Input Fields:
* **Can be empty**  means you can specify the prefix but not pass a value.<br>eg. passing `r/` is valid.
* **Cannot be empty** means you have to specify a value when you specify the prefix.<br>eg. passing `c/` is invalid.
* All input fields should not contain other input prefixes. eg. passing in `What is c/?` as a `QUESTION` to `q/QUESTION` is not supported.

<br>

* Specifying `f/yes` filters for favourited flashcards while `f/no` filters for unfavourited flashcards.
* Supports filtering of one or more different fields. For example:
    - `filter c/SDLC r/5` will filter out flashcards belonging to the SDLC category with a rating of 5.
* Although all fields are optional, a minimum of one field has to be given.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note:
<code>filter r/</code> will filter for all unrated flashcards.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Want to list all your flashcards after using `filter`? Use the [list](#list-all-flashcards--list) command.

</div> 

Examples:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 3**: In this example, we will demonstrate the behaviour of the `↓ key`. Upon pressing the `↓ key`, the answer of the flashcard is shown.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_review_step3.PNG)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Quiz flashcards: `quiz`

Quizzes the current list of flashcards. This puts the user in quiz mode and the user can no longer input commands to the textbox.

Format: `quiz`

Upon entering quiz mode, the following user input will be recognised:
* `↓ key` shows answer and notes of the current flashcard  
* `q` quits quiz mode
* `y` This input will only be recognised after the `↓ key` is pressed. `y` is a feedback to indicate a correct answer. 
* `n` This input will only be recognised after the `↓ key` is pressed. `n` is a feedback to indicate an incorrect answer. 

Upon pressing the `↓ key`, the user will be prompted if they got the answer correct. The user can then press 
`y` to feedback that they got the correct answer or `n` to feedback that they got an incorrect answer.  

The quiz mode works in conjunction with the [statistics](#view-the-statistics-of-flashcard--stats) feature. Quiz attempts are recorded and information about the success frequency can be displayed using the [statistics](#view-the-statistics-of-flashcard--stats) feature.
* Pressing `y` will increase the review and success frequency of the flashcard.
* Pressing `n` will increase the review frequency of the flashcard.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note: Once the user presses <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>, the review and success frequency of the flashcard is updated accordingly even if the user quits the quiz prematurely.
</div>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Steps for entering quiz mode**:

**Step 1**: We want to enter quiz mode to test ourselves on the current list of flashcards. Type the command `quiz` and press Enter.

**Step 3**: In this example, we will demonstrate the behaviour of the `↓ key`. Upon pressing the `↓ key`, we will be prompted if we got the answer correct.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_quiz_step3.PNG)

**Step 4**: We got this answer correct so we will press `y`. This will automatically bring us to the next flashcard.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_quiz_step4.PNG)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort all flashcards : `sort`

Sorts all flashcards according to the criteria given.

Format: `sort <success|reviewed> <-a|-d>`

* Specifying `-a` means sorting by the criteria in ascending order.
* Specifying `-d` means sorting by the criteria in descending order.

Examples: 
* `sort reviewed -a` shows a list of current flashcards sorted according to review frequency in ascending order
* `sort reviewed -d` shows a list of current flashcards sorted according to review frequency in descending order
* `sort success -a` shows a list of current flashcards sorted according to success rate in ascending order
* `sort success -d` shows a list of current flashcards sorted according to success rate in descending order

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note: The review frequency of a flashcard refers to the number of times you review in <b>quiz mode</b>, and the success rate refers to the rate at which you get the question correct in <b>quiz mode</b>.
</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note: The review and success frequencies of a flashcard are <b>only affected by quiz mode</b>, not review mode. So you can think of review mode as a trial that <b>does not affect</b> the statistics of the flashcard.
</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note: Sorting results in a permanent change in the ordering of the flashcards. This means your list of flashcards will follow the sorted order even after you relaunch the app.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View a flashcard  : `view`

Views the specified flashcard. A "snapshot" of the flashcard is taken and displayed in the view pane to the user.

Format: `view INDEX [-a]`

* Views the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed flashcard list.
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer **greater than 0**. eg. 1, 2, 3, …
* If `-a` is specified, the answer and notes of the flashcard will be shown too.

Examples:
* `view 1` shows the 1st flashcard (in the displayed flashcard list) on the view pane without answer and notes.
* `view 1 -a` shows the 1st flashcard (in the displayed flashcard list) on the view pane with answer and notes.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note: Once another command is executed, the view pane will be returned to a blank state even if the shown
flashcard was not modified/deleted.
</div>

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer **greater than 0**. eg. 1, 2, 3, …

Example:
* `stats 1` shows the statistics of the 1st flashcard (in the displayed flashcard list) on the view pane.

The statistics feature works in conjunction with the [quiz](#quiz-flashcards-quiz) feature.

The following information will be displayed on the view pane:
* Question of the flashcard (may be truncated for brevity).
* Reviewed count of the flashcard.
* Correct count of the flashcard.
* Pie chart to show the graphical representation of correct attempts vs wrong attempts in quiz mode of the flashcard. (No pie chart will be shown if the flashcard has not been reviewed.)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: Note: Once another command is executed, the view pane containing the statistics will be returned to a blank state even if the shown
flashcard was not modified/deleted.
</div>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Steps for viewing the statistics of a specific flashcard**:

## FAQ

**Q**: What does it mean if some action is **not supported**?<br>
**A**: It means that our app is not intended to allow said action to work although it may work under certain circumstances.
If you still want to perform the action, do take note that you may face unintended or unexplained behaviour.

**Q**: What is the difference between review mode and quiz mode?<br>
**A**: Review mode is like a sandbox mode where you can move back and forth between flashcards. In quiz mode, you can only go forward. Also, quiz mode asks you for feedback and keeps track of statistics but review mode doesn't.

**Q**: Are success frequency and correct count of a flashcard the same thing?<br>
**A**: Yes. They both refer to how many times you answered with `y` in quiz mode for the flashcard.

**Q**: Why doesn't review mode affect review frequency/count of a flashcard?<br>
**A**: We know the naming may be a little bit confusing but just keep in mind that review mode does **not** affect the statistics (success, review frequency) of a flashcard. Only quiz mode does!

**Q**: What is the success rate of a flashcard?<br>
**A**: Success rate of a flashcard is measured by `(success frequency) / (review frequency) x 100%`. If a flashcard has a review frequency of 0, then its success rate will be 0%.
