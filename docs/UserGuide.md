1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `modduke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Modduke.

1. Using your terminal, navigate to folder containing `modduke.jar` and run the command `java -jar modduke.jar`. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`contact list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`contact add`** `n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to Modduke.

   * **`contact delete`** `n/John Doe` : Deletes `John Doe` from the Modduke.

   * **`contact clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

   * **`exit`** : Exits Modduke.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/CONTACT_NAME`, `CONTACT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/CONTACT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `t/TAG…​` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/CONTACT_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/CONTACT_NAME` is also acceptable.

* All parameters are `CASE-SENSITIVE` unless stated otherwise.<br>

* The `CONTACT_NAME` parameter refers to the full name of the contact.

* There are 2 special tags `prof` and `ta`. Contacts with either of these tags will be classified as professor or ta
 respectively. Users are not allowed to tag a contact as both `prof` and `ta`. Hence, if your professor is also your ta, only the
 `prof` tag should be used.

</div>

### Fuzzy Find Completion (Fzf)

Currently Modduke supports Fuzzy Find Completion from v1.4 onward. You can trigger the fzf mode
using `ctrl + space`. Currently our fzf will search through all contact names, module names and meeting names and will
match entries that contain the prefix entered.

![Fzf Example](images/FzfCompletionExample.gif)

You can exit fzf mode by manually pressing `esc`. You will also be taken automatically out of fzf mode once you select one
of the fzf options by navigating to desired option using arrow keys and making the selection by pressing `enter`. Alternatively,
you can make the selection using your mouse.

Note that the intuitive `tab` and `shift-tab` navigation is currently NOT supported in v1.4 although you can use these keys to jump to the first option in the fzf menu.

### Autocompletion

Currently Modduke supports autocompletion for the following fields for v1.3 onward. Note that this is a legacy
feature and most of its functionality can be achieved using our newer Fzf completion.

* Contact Name -  Triggered using `cn/`
* Module Name -  Triggered using `mdn/`
* Meeting Name -  Triggered using `mtn/`

Typing in these trigger phrases will turn the text yellow to show that CommandBox has entered Autocompletion Mode.
Use `Tab` to scroll forward and `Shift-Tab` to iterate backwards through suggestions.

Note that this autocompletion can only be triggered at the end of input string e.g.
- `contact edit cn/` will trigger the autocomplete but
- `contact edit cn/ p/98830181` this would not as there is text after the trigger phrase.

![Autocomplete Example](images/AutocompleteExample.gif)

* Note that while in Autocomplete mode you cannot edit suggestions unless you iterated back to your own input or you press `Backspace`.
* Pressing `Enter` will lock in your current selection and take you out of Autocomplete mode.

### Command History
Similar to other command lines, Modduke supports a command history function where pressing the up or down keys brings
users back to previous successful commands.

The `Up` key brings users to previous command wheras the `Down` key brings users to the next command in the command history
queue.

* Note that the commands must be successful to be logged into command history and that command history only tracks commands
in the current session. This means if Moduke is restarted, commands in the previous sessions won't be available.
