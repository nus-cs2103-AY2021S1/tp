`Calo` is a desktop app that is **designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day**.
It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you are a skilled typer, you can carry out various tasks such as adding new exercises and checking records for
previous days much faster than the traditional GUI apps.

# 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 
**:information_source: Notes about the command format: <br>**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. <br>
  e.g. in `add e/EXERCISE c/CALORIES`, `EXERCISE` is a parameter which can be used as `add e/Push Up c/1000`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `e/EXERCISE c/CALORIES [at/DATE]` can be used as `e/Push Up c/1000 at/29-09-2020` or as `e/Push Up c/1000`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/gym`, `t/school t/house` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `e/EXERCISE c/CALORIES`, `c/CALORIES e/EXERCISE` is also acceptable.

## 3.2. Add exercises : `add`

Adds an exercise to the application, with date, calories burnt, muscles worked and tags as optional.
Notices how the exercise appears at the end of the list and the result bar will show the equivalent weight that you burnt.
If you have set a goal for the day, it will also tell you how much more calories to burn to achieve your goal.

![add command message](images/AddCommand.png)

Format: `add n/EXERCISE d/DESCRIPTION [at/DATE] [c/CALORIES] [m/MUSCLE] [t/TAG]...`

- The format for the DATE should be in the form of DD-MM-YYYY.
- If DATE is not provided, the default date will be the current day.
- Exercises are uniquely identified by names, descriptions, dates, and tags. Duplicate exercises cannot be added to `Calo`. You may consider including additional information in description (e.g. 2nd time) if you want to do the same exercise more than once a day.

Examples:
- `add n/running d/10 mins at/31-12-2020 c/100 m/chest m/arm t/home t/gym`

## 3.3. Update exercises : `update`

Updates an existing exercise.

Format: `update INDEX [n/EXERCISE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [at/DATE] [c/CALORIES] [m/MUSCLE]... [t/TAG]...`
- Edits the workout at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed workout list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
- **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.

- You can remove all the exercise/muscle's tags by typing t/ or m/ respectively (without specifying any tags after it).
- For all other fields, supplying an empty value will result in an error message.

- `update 1 n/Push up d/30 at/09-07-2020 c/260 m/chest m/arm t/home t/gym` Updates the exercise, the description, the date, calories burnt, muscles worked, and tags of the 1st exercise to be `push up`, `30`,  `09-07-2020`, `260`, `[chest, arm]`, and `[home, gym]` respectively.
- `update 1 m/` will remove all the previous muscle tags from the 1st exercise.
- `update 1 n/` will result in an error since the name of the 1st exercise is blank.

For this command, `update 4 n/Push Up`, the exercises will be changed as follow.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 
:information_source: Notes about the command format:

* **Absolute Path:** 
  Path that contains root element, e.g. C:\Users\user_name\Desktop\FILE_NAME.json

* **Relative Path:**
  Path will take reference from the file that contains **Calo.jar** For example, if `Calo` is inside
  the `C:/Users/UserName/App` and the user entered `data\archived_file.json` as the destination, the archived file will be
  at `C:/Users/UserName/App/data/archived_file.json`
</div>

- The format for the DATE should be in the form of DD-MM-YYYY.  

- The user can input calorie value, muscles or tags to overwrite the default value defined by the template. If the user inputs no calories, then the exercise will have the default value in the template.
