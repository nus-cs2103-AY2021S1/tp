# 1. Welcome
Calo is a desktop app that is **designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day**. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a skilled typer, you can carry out various tasks such as adding new exercises and checking records for previous days much faster than the traditional GUI apps.
