##Introduction - Gabriella Teh

PlaNus is a project done under NUS module CS2103T by a group of five aspiring computer science students.

PlaNus is **task managing desktop application** for students in NUS with many projects and deadlines, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI). PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is now simple and quick!

Objectives of PlaNus:
1. Provide students with a detailed breakdown of how much time they spend on their tasks and lessons in their respective modules.
2. Allow students to have a organised view of their schedule. (coming soon in v1.3B)
3. Allocate tasks and lessons to their schedule automatically. (coming soon in v1.4)

* Items in square brackets are optional input. e.g `desc:DESCRIPTION` <br>
  `[desc:DESCRIPTION]` can be used as `title:homework 1 desc:science project` or just as `title:homework 1`.
