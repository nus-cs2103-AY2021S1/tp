## Introduction

**Inventoryinator** is a **desktop app for managing game inventories**, and supports
**any generic game** where you need to sort and collate resources. If you ever find
yourself wondering how many resources you have back at home base, or are unsure whether
you can craft your next upgrade, then this is the app for you!

Our app is optimized for use via the **typing** of commands, while your inventory is
shown on our **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, Inventoryinator can
get your inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This User Guide will help you get started with the setup of Inventoryinator and provide a
quick reference of the features available and how to use them. You can use the table of
contents below for easy access to sections in this document.

## Features
In this section, you can find a comprehensive list of Inventoryinator's commands and their descriptions, as of v1.4.
For each command, you will find a written description of the command's functions. For experienced users, you can
refer to the more succinct name, synopsis, description and example sections to directly access the information you need.

```
NOTE:
We have removed all apostrophes (') from our example commands, 
but that does not mean you can't use them.
We have only done so because github (or something else) formats apostrophes
to be different from the ones on our keyboard, which affects our 
Inventoryinator's case-sensitive commands.
Now, you can copy and paste our example commands without worry.
:)
```

### Adding an item: `addi`
(Implemented by: Zhengdao)

tracking your item. You will need to provide an item name. You can optionally provide the initial item quantity,

### Adding a new Recipe: `addr`

you will see later. You will need to provide a product name as well as names and quantities of the items used to
create this product. You can optionally provide the product quantity (if the recipe produces more than 1 of the product)
