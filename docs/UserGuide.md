## 2. Getting Started
Before you begin, here's a quick start guide on how to get Eva up and running on your computer!

1. Ensure you have [Java `11`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `Eva.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the downloaded jar file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Eva.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. If you face any issues, refer to our [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Section](#4-faq) 
below. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. 
Note how the app generate some sample data when you first launch it!<br> 
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   
   Here are some example commands you can try:

   * **`list a-`** : Lists all applicants, changes the panel to display the applicant list.

## 3. Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
Here are some general information you would need to know about our commands as you read through the user guide.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
* Upon the accidental inclusion of fields that are not meant to be repeated, Eva only takes the last parameter entered.<br>
  e.g. The command `adds n/John Doe n/Alex Yeoh p/98765432 e/email@email.com a/123 test st p/23456789`, will be recognised as `adds n/Alex Yeoh e/email@email.com a/123 test st p/23456789`

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes about input format:** <br>

In Eva, using our commands, you can store and access information about staff and applicants. Information includes details like name, phone number 
and more. As such, in order to store and access these details in a neat and tidy manner, be sure to follow these guidelines
on storing and accessing these details as shown in the table below.

</div>

<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Constraints</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>NAME</strong></code></td><td>can contain only alphanumeric characters, cannot be blank, and has a character limit of 70 characters.</td><td><code>John Doe</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>EMAIL</strong></code></td><td>should be of the format local-part@domain <br>where the local-part should contain alphanumeric characters or special characters which includes the characters !#$%&'*+/=?`{&#124;}~^.-_ <br>The domain name should have at least 2 characters and contain only alphanumeric with a period or a hyphen for the characters in between if needed.</td><td><code>john_Doe12345@example123.com</code></td></tr>

<tr><td><code><strong>DATE</strong></code></td><td>must be in the format <code>DD/MM/YYYY</code></td><td><code>06/07/2020</code> represents the 6th of July 2020<br> Note: Eva automatically corrects wrong dates like <code>30/02/2020</code> and <code>31/11/2020</code> to <code>29/02/2020</code> and <code>30/11/2020</code> respectively.</td></tr>
</table>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

Eva automatically saves any changes made to the records in your hard disk when using the commands below!
There is no need to save manually! <br>
You can also find the records in the `data` folder where the `eva.jar` file is located.

</div>

Here is a brief overview on how this section is arranged. 

The first section brings you through the 
[different panels](#31-eva-gui) you will see in our application. After getting familiar with that, we will share some 
[general system commands](#32-system-commands) you can use at any point in time. 

In the third section, 
we will bring you through the [features we have implemented for staff](#33-staff-commands). 

Following which, you will be introduced to the [features for managing applicant records](#34-applicant-commands). 

Finally, you will learn about [how to add and delete comments to applicants and staff](#35-comment-commands) and 
[our very own unique script engine](#36-script-engine-experimental) (experimental feature). By then, you will definitely become a master in using Eva! 
So let's get started! 

### 3.1. Eva GUI

Before we dive into the features, let us help you familiarize yourself with our GUI!

As of `v1.4`, Eva currently has four different panels it can switch between:

#### 3.1.1. Staff List : `Staff List Panel`

This panel is where you can see all your staffs in a condensed list view.

![staffListPanel intro](images/ugimages/Intro1.png)

#### 3.1.2. Staff Profile : `Staff Profile Panel`

This is where you can zoom in on an individual staff and view more information about their leaves and comments.

![staffProfilePanel intro](images/ugimages/Intro2.png)

#### 3.1.3. Applicant List : `Applicant List Panel`

Similar to the [`Staff List`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel), this is where you can see all your applicants in a condensed list view.

![applicantListPanel intro](images/ugimages/Intro3.png)

#### 3.1.4. Applicant Profile : `Applicant Profile Panel`

This is also similar to the [`Staff Profile`](#312-staff-profile--staff-profile-panel) where you can zoom in on an individual applicant and view more information about them.

However, notice how the placement of the comments section differs from the [`Staff List`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel).

![applicantProfilePanel intro](images/ugimages/Intro4.png)

These four panels form the core of Eva to be sure to familiarize yourself with them! Once ready, move on to the [Commands](#32-system-commands)!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**
Eva launches into the [`Staff List Panel`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel) by default.
However, Eva remembers which list you last looked at and will open at [`Applicant List Panel`](#313-applicant-list--applicant-list-panel) if you exited the app from there!

</div>

### 3.2. System Commands

#### 3.2.1. Open help window : `help`

If you're not sure of how to use Eva at any point in time, use the `help` command!

The `help` command shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

Format: `help`

![help message](images/ugimages/Help.png)

#### 3.2.2. Exit the program : `exit`

Done using Eva? The `exit` command exits the program!

Format: `exit`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** The exit command immediately closes the app upon execution.<br>

As mentioned earlier in [Features](#3-features), there is no need to manually save data! So don't worry if you accidentally close your app!

</div>

![exit](images/ugimages/Exit.png)

### 3.3. Staff commands

Eva makes use of these staff commands to give you the ability to keep track of your staffs which help you make business and manpower decisions.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* All commands under staff can only be done on either [`Staff List`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel) or [`Staff Profile`](#312-staff-profile--staff-profile-panel) except `adds`, which can be done on any panel.<br>
 
* On a [`Staff Profile`](#312-staff-profile--staff-profile-panel), only the details of the profile that is being viewed can be changed.<br>

</div>


#### 3.3.1. List all staff : `list s-`

The [`Staff List Panel`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel) panel serves as your primary tool to give you an overview of all the staffs in your company.

This command changes the panel to the [`Staff List`](#31-eva-gui) and shows a list of all staffs in the Eva Database.

Format: `list s-`

The image below shows what you would see after executing this example.

![listStaff](images/ugimages/ListStaff.png)

#### 3.3.2. Add a staff : `adds`

As storing staff records is a primary activity in Eva, you can use this command to add a staff record into Eva. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

A staff record can contain the details listed below:
 - Name*
 - Phone Number*
 - Email*
 - Address*
 - Tags
 - Comments
 - Leaves 
 
The fields marked with a asterisk (*) are compulsory and have to be provided in the parameters below.
Without any one of these fields, Eva will not accept your input. <br>

To manage leave records for each staff, please refer to the commands 
[`addl`](#337-record-leave-taken-by-staff-addl) and [`dell`](#338-delete-leave-taken-by-staff-dell). <br>
 
Below are some notes about the parameters you can add:
 - A staff can have any number of tags (including 0) <br>
 - A staff can have any number of comments (including 0) <br>
 - Each staff is uniquely identified by their name. In the event you wish to add 2 staff records with the same name,
   please ensure that both their phone number and email addresses are different

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>

 - The details of each field can be provided in any order. <br>
 
 - In the case of multiple similar prefixes, the argument of the last prefix will be used (excluding tags and comments).<br>
 
</div>

Format: `adds n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​[c/COMMENTS]…`
 
Examples:
* To add only the necessary fields <br>

The image below shows what you would see after executing the last example given. Notice that Betsy Crowe is now recorded as a staff in our database.

![addStaff](images/ugimages/AddStaff.png)

#### 3.3.3. Find a staff : `find s-`

The command serves as a tool to help you quickly find all the staffs with the given name in your company.

This command will show a list of staffs whose name contains one of the given names. It changes the panel to the [`Staff List`](#31-eva-gui) to display the result.

Format `find FIND_TYPE- KEYWORD`

Examples:
* `find s- Doe`

* `find s- Alex`

The image below shows what you would see after executing the last example given. Notice that no other staffs are listed as there is only one Alex.

![findStaff](images/ugimages/FindStaff.png)

#### 3.3.4. View : `view`

To get to the [`Staff Profile Panel`](#312-staff-profile--staff-profile-panel) mentioned earlier, 
use this command from the [`Staff List Panel`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel). Over here, you can take a closer look at the leaves and comments of a staff.

This command brings you to the profile panel of the staff at the specified index. 

Format: `view INDEX`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

* Only description of comments can be edited. Title and Date cannot be edited.
 
* In the case of multiple similar prefixes, the description of the last prefix will be used (excluding tags and comments).

</div>

Example:

* `edits 1 n/Balakrishnan Roy`

The image below shows what you would see after executing the last example given. Notice how Roy Balakrishnan has changed to Balakrishnan Roy.

![editStaff](images/ugimages/EditStaff.png)


#### 3.3.7. Record leave taken by staff: `addl`

In a company, it is important to keep track of your manpower and know who will be working on which day.
As such, Eva allows you to record down the leaves taken by a staff and show you the total number of leaves taken as well.

Format: `addl INDEX l/d/DATE [d/DATE] [l/d/DATE [d/DATE]]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

* Addition of multiple leaves using the same command is supported. A leave can have either one (single day) or two dates (start and end inclusive).<br>

* Dates can be input in any order. Eva will sort the leaves and dates according to which date comes first.<br>

* Eva automatically tells you if a staff has either already taken the leave, is in the process of taking it or has not taken the leave. This can be seen on the [Staff Profile](#312-staff-profile--staff-profile-panel). <br>

* Eva also automatically tallies up the total number of leave days taken by a staff and displays the total below the leaves! This can be seen on the [Staff Profile](#312-staff-profile--staff-profile-panel). <br>

</div>

Examples:
* `list s-` followed by `addl 2 l/d/20/10/2020` adds the leave record with the given date(s) to the 2nd person in the shown list.
* `find s- Betsy` followed by `addl 1 l/d/20/10/2020` adds the leave to the 1st person in the results of the `find s-` command.
* `addl 1 l/d/08/10/2020 d/10/10/2020 l/d/20/10/2020`
* `addl 7 l/d/09/09/2020`
* `addl 7 l/d/10/10/2020 d/08/10/2020`

The image below shows what you would see after executing the last example given above. Notice how the leave appears on Betsy's record.

![addLeave](images/ugimages/AddLeave.png)

#### 3.3.8. Delete leave taken by staff: `dell`

Sometimes a staff becomes unable to take their leave and cancels or postpones, 
Eva allows you to delete their recorded leaves. The total leave taken count is also automatically updated.

This command removes the record of leave taken by a staff, specified by the date given.<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:exclamation: **Important! <br>
Please take note that this action is irreversible.**

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**
If a leave record has a date range that lasts from 08/11/2020 to 12/11/2020, any date keyed in that date range will cause the whole record to be deleted.<br>

</div>

Format: `dell INDEX d/DATE`

Examples:
* `list s-` followed by `dell 2 d/09/10/2020` deletes the leave record of which the given date coincides with from the 2nd person in shown list.
* `find s- Betsy` followed by `dell 1 d/09/10/2020` deletes the leave from the 1st person in the results of the `find s-` command.

The image below shows what you would see after executing the last example given above. Notice how the leave is deleted from Betsy's record.

![deleteLeave](images/ugimages/DeleteLeave.png)

#### 3.3.9. Clear staff database : `clear s-`

In any case that you might want to remove all staff records, you can always use this command. <br>
This command clears all staff entries from the Eva database. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:exclamation: **Important! <br> 
Please take note that this action is irreversible.**

</div>

Format: `clear s-`

The image below shows what you would see after using this command. Notice that there are no more records of staff in the
[`Staff List`](#311-staff-list--staff-list-panel).

### 3.6. Script Engine (Experimental)

Eva provides a built-in script to execute JavaScript that can be used to extend the features of Eva.

To write a script to extend the features of Eva,
please refer to [Nashorn official website](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-nashorn.html)
for supported JavaScript features, and learn how to import Java classes to extend Eva features.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:exclamation: **Important!** <br>

* Please take note that this feature is not ready and is **purely experimental**.

* While loading scripts can extend the features of Eva and simplify the workflow, a script can also break the application. Use with caution! <br>

* Scripts downloaded over Internet could contain malicious content and pose security threats to your computer. Use at your own risks! <br>

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Eva home folder.

**Q**: How do I find the data file?<br>
**A**: The `data` folder is automatically generated in the same directory as your Eva.jar file. The `data` folder should contain the data you have saved inside some `.json` files.

**Q**: I can't run the app by double clicking! What do I do?<br>
**A**: Open terminal and [traverse](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/) to the directory the `Eva.jar` file is in. Then type the command `java -jar Eva.jar`.
