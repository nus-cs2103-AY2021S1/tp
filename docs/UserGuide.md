McGymmy is a **desktop app for Software Engineers who need help managing their diet, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). While we are primarily targetting software engineers who are familiar with the CLI, those who spend a large amount of time at their desk can still benefit from this application by saving time as opposed to the more traditional caloric tracker applications. <br>
If you can type fast, McGymmy can log your food intake faster than traditional GUI apps. McGymmy aims to help users track their caloric and macronutrient intake in an efficient way that does not interfere with one's workflow.

This document aims to showcase all of McGymmy's commands.

## 5. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

A typical *command* in *McGymmy* consists of a *Command Word* followed by several *parameters*.

For example in `add -n scrambled eggs -p 100`, `add` is a *Command Word* and `-n scrambled eggs` and `-p 100` are *parameters*.

**How to intepret the each command's format**:

We will follow the following convention for each command's format:

`COMMAND_WORD PARAMETERS [OPTIONAL_PARAMETERS]`, e.g. `add -n NAME [-p PROTEIN] [-f FATS] [-c CARBS] [-d DATE]`.

* `COMMAND_WORD` is the name of the command to be executed, and is always the first word in the *command*.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n NAME -p PROTEIN`, `NAME` and `PROTEIN` are parameters which can be used as `add bacon -p 200`.
  
* Prefixes that precede parameters represent *flags* that indicate which parameter is being referenced. Parameters that are not preceded by a flag are denoted as *flag-less* parameters. For simplicity, the [flag + parameter input] together will be referenced as a single parameter.<br>
  e.g. in `find example -t lunch`, `example` represents a flag-less parameter while `-t lunch` is referred as a parameter with flag `-t` and parameter input `lunch`.

* Flag-less parameters always have to be the first parameter after the command word.<br>
  e.g. in `edit 1 -n chicken`, the flag-less parameter is `1` and the `n` parameter is `chicken`. However for `edit -n chicken 1`, there is no flag-less parameter, and the `n` parameter is `chicken 1`.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `-n NAME [-f FATS]` can be used as `-n bacon -f 10` or as `-n bacon`.

* Parameters and optional parameters with flags can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-c CARBS -p PROTEIN [-f FATS]`, `-p PROTEIN [-f FATS] -c CARBS` is also acceptable.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[commnand;]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `delete 1;`, `delete 2; delete 1;` etc.

* Entering the same parameter twice will concatenate the inputs.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n potato -n chip`, the `n` parameters will be concatenated to `potato chip`, and a new item with the name `potato chip` will be created.

</div>

### 5.1 Viewing help : `help`

Stuck and unsure of how to execute a certain command? The `help` command allows you to view
information on all available commands. It also enables you to display detailed information on a specific
command. This way, you won't have any trouble utilising McGymmy to its full potential.

Format: `help [COMMAND]`

Examples:
* `help` - this will display all available commands.
* `help add` - this will display a help message specific to the `add` command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `help` Command.
 * `help help` will flag as an invalid command.
 * `help` will not work with created macros, the `listmacro` command should be used instead.
</div>

![help message](images/CommandImagesForUG/Help.png)

### 5.2 Adding a food item: `add`

The `add` command allows you to store your food items into McGymmy with ease. You can also
specify additional details for your food item entry, creating a more detailed and customisable
diet-tracking experience.

Format: `add -n NAME [-p PROTEIN] [-f FATS] [-c CARBS] [-d DATE] [-t TAG]`

Examples:
* `add -n potato -p 100 -c 5 -f 0`
* `add -n McSpicy`
* `add -n Wonton Mee -c 10`
* `add -n Sushi -d 20/04/2020`
* `add -n Burger -t FastFood`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `add` Command.
 * The default value for `PROTEIN`, `FATS` and `CARBS` is 0. The default date is the day in which the food item is added.<br>
 * Values of `PROTEIN`, `FATS` and `CARBS` must be a non-negative integer, less than 1000g.<br>
 * To view the list of supported date formats, see *Appendix A*.<br>
</div>

![add command example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Add.png)

### 5.3 Tagging food items : `tag`

Tags are customisable labels that help organise your food items. The `tag` command enables
you to tag food items with a specific label, which allows you to locate and filter the food
items with greater ease and create a more organised food list. 

Format: `tag INDEX -t TAG_NAME`

Examples:
* `tag 1 -t Breakfast` - adds the `Breakfast` tag to the first food item in your list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `tag` command.

* Tags `TAG_NAME` for food item at the specified `INDEX`.
* `TAG_NAME` is case-sensitive.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​ that is smaller than 2^31 or the size of the list, whichever lower.
* Tags for food items must be less than 20 characters.
* The list will show all items after tagging

</div>

![tag command example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Tag.png)

### 5.4 Untagging food items : `untag`

Wrongly tagged a food item? Not to worry, the `untag` command allows for quick and easy
removal of a specified tag.

Format: `untag INDEX -t TAG_NAME`

Examples:
* `untag 1 -t Breakfast` - removes the `Breakfast` tag from the first food item in your list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `untag` command.

* Untags `TAG_NAME` for food item at the specified `INDEX`.
* `TAG_NAME` is case-sensitive.

</div>

![untag command example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Untag.png)

### 5.5 Finding a food item: `find`

Easy and quick filtering of food items is made possible via the `find` command.
This command allows you to specify certain criteria to filter the current food list by,
allowing you to easily locate past entries.

Format: `find [KEYWORDS] [-n WORDS_IN_NAME] [-t WORDS_IN_TAG] [-d DATE]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `find` command.

* Filters the displayed list of food items to only include food items corresponding to the provided parameters.
* The `[KEYWORDS]`, `[WORDS_IN_NAME]` and `[WORDS_IN_TAG]` parameters will only find food items that contain at least one of the complete words specified.<br>
  e.g. `find chick` will not return the food item with the name "Chicken Rice" but `find chicken lemak` will return both the food items "Chicken Rice" and "Nasi Lemak".
* `KEYWORDS` and `WORDS_IN_NAME` are not case sensitive but `WORDS_IN_TAG` is case sensitive.

</div>

Examples:
* `find` - finds all food items
* `find -n Sushi -d 20/04/2020` - finds all food items with the word "Sushi" in it's name and date "20/04/2020"
* `find -t lunch dinner` - finds all food items with tag "lunch" and/or tag "dinner"
* `find sushi lunch` - finds all food items that have the keywords "sushi" and/or "lunch" in their name and/or tag

![find_command_example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Find.png)

### 5.6 Clearing food items: `clear`

### 5.12 Undoing the previous command : `undo`

The `undo` command allows you to reverse the change of the previous command. This makes
it easier to reverse mistakes made in McGymmy.

Format: `undo`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `undo` command.

* Undo command can be called multiple times.
* Help command will be ignored when undoing. 
For example, if the user calls the following commands in sequence:
`add -n Burger`, `help edit`, `undo`, the undo command will undo the adding operation, not the help one.
* All additional input after the *command word* `undo` will be ignored. E.g. `undo` and `undo 123` will have the same effect.

![Undo command example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Undo.png)

</div>

### 5.13 Creating a macro command : `macro`

Macros are custom shortcuts that ease the diet-tracking process. It allows you to create custom
commands by combining multiple commands together. This is a powerful tool that removes the need for
repetitive long-winded command execution. The `macro` command specifically stores a new macro into
your McGymmy system.

*__WARNING:__* this is an advanced feature!

Format: `macro MACRONAME FLAG_1 FLAG_2 ... ; COMMAND_1 PARAMETERS_TO_COMMAND_1; [COMMAND_2 PARAMETERS_TO_COMMAND_2; ...]` <br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the `macro` command.

* If any of the jargon below seem unclear, refer to *How to intepret the each command's format* under section *[5. Features](#5-features)* above.

* Creates a macro with name `MACRONAME` which takes in parameters `FLAG_1 FLAG_2...` which executes `COMMAND_1; COMMAND_2; ...`.

* Parameters to the macro can be substituted in the `PARAMETERS_TO_COMMAND` using the syntax: `\FLAG_NAME`.

* Flag-less parameters can be substituted using the syntax: `\$`.

* Using `undo` after creating a macro using this command will remove it.

* Read the examples below for more information.

</div>

Examples:
* `macro addWith100cal p ; add -n \$ -c 100 -p \p`
    * Example usage of this macro: `addWith100cal Banana -p 200`
    * The following command will be executed by the macro: `add -n Banana -c 100 -p 200`
    * i.e. in `add -n \$ -c 100 -p \p`, `\$` and `\p` will be substituted with Banana and 200 respectively.

* `macro addFoodWithFries; add -n \$ ; add -n \$ With Fries`
    * Example usage of this macro: `addFoodWithFries Ice Cream`
    * The following commands will be executed by the macro: `add -n Ice Cream` and `add -n Ice Cream With Fries`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Be careful when creating a macro!
* It is possible to create a macro with errors!
* The commands in the macro will only be checked for errors when you run the macro itself.
* e.g. Entering `macro test; add` will create a new macro, but every time you execute the macro `test`, the error message from `add` telling you it requires the name parameter will be shown.

</div>

![Macro command example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Macro.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: When using it with conjunction with the undo command, macro will only undo the commands one at a time within the chain of macro commands<br>

</div>

### 5.14 Listing all macros : `listmacro`

The `listmacro` command displays information on the available macros in the terminal, which allows you to keep track of
all macros currently in the McGymmy system.

Format: `listmacro [macro]`

Examples:
* `listmacro` - this will display all available macros.
* `listmacro kfc` - this will display information on the `kfc` macro.

![List Macro command example](images/CommandImagesForUG/Listmacro.png)

When using `listmacro` with a name of a `macro` it will show the details of the macro
Details include:
* Parameters
* Declaration details
<br>

![List_Macro_command_with_optional_parameters_example](images/CommandImagesForUG/ListmacroCommand.png)

### 5.15 Deleting a macro: `remmacro`
