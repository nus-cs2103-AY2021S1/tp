McGymmy is a **desktop app for Software Engineers who need help managing their diet, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). While we are primarily targetting software engineers who are familiar with the CLI, those who spend a large amount of time at their desk can still benefit from this application by saving time as opposed to the more traditional caloric tracker applications. <br>
If you can type fast, McGymmy can log your food intake faster than traditional GUI apps. McGymmy aims to help users track their caloric and macronutrient intake in an efficient way that does not interfere with one's workflow.

This document aims to showcase all of McGymmy's commands.

## 5. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

A typical *command* in *McGymmy* consists of a *Command Word* followed by several *parameters*.

For example in `add -n scrambled eggs -p 100`, `add` is a *Command Word* and `-n scrambled eggs` and `-p 100` are *parameters*.

**How to intepret the each command's format**:

We will follow the following convention for each command's format:

`COMMAND_WORD PARAMETERS [OPTIONAL_PARAMETERS]`, e.g. `add -n NAME [-p PROTEIN] [-f FATS] [-c CARBS] [-d DATE]`.

* `COMMAND_WORD` is the name of the command to be executed, and is always the first word in the *command*.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n NAME -p PROTEIN`, `NAME` and `PROTEIN` are parameters which can be used as `add bacon -p 200`.
  
* Prefixes that precede parameters represent flags that indicate which parameter is being referenced. Parameters that are not preceded by a flag are denoted as flag-less parameters. For simplicity, the [flag + parameter input] together will be referenced as a single parameter.<br>
  e.g. in `find example -t lunch`, `example` represents a flag-less parameter while `-t lunch` is referred as a parameter with flag `-t` and parameter input `lunch`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `-n NAME [-f FATS]` can be used as `-n bacon -f 10` or as `-n bacon`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[commnand;]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `delete 1;`, `delete 2; delete 1;` etc.

* Parameters and optional parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-c CARBS -p PROTEIN [-f FATS]`, `-p PROTEIN [-f FATS] -c CARBS` is also acceptable.
