## Commands

This section provides support for the commands required to perform desired actions on Warenager.
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note for command input format:**<br>

* Words enclosed in `<>` are the input parameters to be supplied by the user. <br>
  For example, in `n/<name>`, `name` is a parameter which can be used as `n/Pork Belly`.

* Prefixes not enclosed with anything is compulsory, must be provided by the user, and duplicate is not allowed. <br>
  For example, in `list lt/<list type>`, the `lt/<list type>` must be provided and no duplicate is allowed. <br>
  `list` and `list lt/all lt/bookmark` are invalid command formats, but `list lt/all` is valid.

* Prefixes enclosed with `[]` is optional, can be omitted by the user, and duplicate is not allowed. <br>
  For example, in `update sn/<serial number> [n/<name]`, the `n/<name>` can be omitted. <br>
  `update sn/Fairprice1 n/Apple` and `update sn/Fairprice1` are both valid command formats, <br>
  but `update sn/Fairprice1 n/Apple n/Banana` is not a valid command format.

* Compulsory prefixes with `...` trailing after them can be used more than one time in one command. <br>
  For example, in `delete sn/<serial number>...`, the `sn/<serial number>` must be provided and duplicates are allowed. <br>
  `delete sn/Fairprice1` and `delete sn/Fairprice1 sn/Ntuc1` are both valid command formats.
  
* Multiple prefixes combined with `|` means only one of them can be provided at a single command. <br>
  For example, in `update sn/<serial number> [iq/<increment value> | nq/<new quantity>]`, at most one of `iq/<increment value>`
  or `nq/<new quantity>` may be provided. <br>
  `update sn/Fairprice1 iq/+10 nq/100` is an invalid command format, but `update sn/Fairprice1 iq/+10`, 
  `update sn/Fairprice1 nq/100`, `update sn/Fairprice1` are all valid command formats.

* Prefixes given can be in any order. <br>
  For example, `update sn/Fairprice1 n/Apple` and `update n/Apple sn/Fairprice1` are both valid and behave exactly the same.

* All 15 valid prefixes that are used in Warenager are <br>
  `n/<name>, s/<source>, q/<quantity>, lq/<low quantity>, l/<location>, lt/<list type>, sn/<serial number>, nq/<new quantity>,
  iq/<increment value>, nt/<note>, ni/<note index>, st/<statistics type>, by/<field>, o/<order>, fn/<file name>`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Warning for invalid prefixes**

Unexpected behaviors might occur if any prefix besides the 15 valid prefixes recognized by Warenager is supplied by the user. <br>
In general, Warenager will not be able to parse any prefix besides the 15 valid prefixes above and will recognize the
invalid prefix as a parameter instead. <br>
For example, in `delete sn/Fairprice1 x/Random`, `Fairprice1 x/Random` will be recognized as the `<serial number>`. 

</div>

<h4>Below is a guided example for deleting stocks:</h4><br>
Before you start any deletion, make sure to use the command `list lt/all` to list all
the stocks you have in Warenager. 
![delete_step1](images/delete/delete_step1.png)

Multiple stocks can also be deleted at the same time. Let's delete 2 stocks with serial numbers `COURTS3`
and `COURTS4`. It can be done by chaining the serial numbers when deleting.<br>

### Command Suggestion
Sometimes user will type in wrong commands. Warenager will help such user by suggesting the correct format

The suggestion will only be made if the command format is invalid or unknown. If the command is valid, but there
are errors such as serial number not found, then Warenager will not suggest anything to the user and instead displays
an error message.
