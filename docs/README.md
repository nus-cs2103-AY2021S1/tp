* This is **a desktop application designed for team leaders of small software projects.** While it has a Graphical
Interface, Taskmania is primarily designed to be written in a command line fashion such that commands guide the user
through the application. This is ideal for a user who is a fast typer as this user would never have to reach
for a mouse and hence save time that way.
* Some project leaders manage their team over Whatsapp / Telegram which can get cumbersome and difficult to keep
 track of and we want to provide a way for them to see at a glance the progress of their team thus far to better
  gauge what has to be done.
* Some Use cases for Taskmania include:
  * Create new software projects to manage
  * Adding team members to each project
  * Multiple team members spanning different projects
  * Modifying information of each team member
  * Viewing tasks to be done at a glance
