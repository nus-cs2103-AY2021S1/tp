#Documentation Style and Methods:

**Setting up and maintaining the project website:**

* We used [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) to manage the documentation via Github Pages.
* The `docs/` folder is used for documentation about the project, the userguide, developer guide, usecases, userprofiles and more.

**Style guidance:**

* Our project follows the [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).

* Also relevant is the [_[se-edu/guides] **Markdown coding standard**_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html)

**Diagrams:**

* Our UML diagrams are done via [_[se-edu/guides] **Using PlantUML**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html)
