**Setting up and maintaining the project website:**

* We use [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder is used for documentation.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] **Using Jekyll for project documentation**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html).


**Style guidance:**

* Follow the [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).

* Also relevant is the [_[se-edu/guides] **Markdown coding standard**_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html)

**Diagrams:**

* See the [_[se-edu/guides] **Using PlantUML**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html)

* Some diagrams were created with [**Powerpoint**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/microsoft-365/powerpoint), one can learn powerpoint using the following guide [**Microsoft Powerpoint Support**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint)
