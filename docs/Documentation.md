#Calo Documentation Guide


**Documentation**  

* Each of the documentation page is written in `.md` file, whcih makes use of [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* **Reason for Choosing:** We choose to use it because it is simple to learn and deploy (so we can focus on the code and its quality)
and yet is friendly to browse on websites.
* **File Location:** All the documenation-related files (inclding images, `.md` file) is within `roots/docs/`.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] **Using Jekyll for project documentation**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html).


**Style guidance:**
* The code used in development of `Calo` follows  [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).


**Learning Resources**
* Markdown which is used to style `.md` file: [_[se-edu/guides] **Markdown coding standard**_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html)
* Diagram: [_[se-edu/guides] **Using PlantUML**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html)
* Convert `.md` to `.pdf`: [_[se-edu/guides] **Saving web documents as PDF files**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/savingPdf.html)
